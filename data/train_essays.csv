People who make their own decisions on life important matters shouldnt need no help with decisions because they have it all planned out its called being responsible. Its always good to make the decisions on your own. There fore you dont need no seek guidance from other people.

People, who value self reliance is doing things on their own like homework,classwork,jobs but then they are talking about should they take guidance from experts, i would take guidance from experts because they know more. they have been there and they have experienced everything so they know how it is. I feel like doing everything on your own can be difficult and tirering and then you just feel like giving up.

In conclusion i think people should get ideas and help from experts and authorities just like i said before they have been there and they are more experienced and i feel like they can help you a lot with anything and help you be successful.",0.0
e_3vs2fnry,-5,"Hey there!  I'm super excited to write this essay about our school's distance learning program. As an 8th grader, I've had the chance to experience both traditional schooling and online classes, and let me tell you, they're totally different.

First off, let's talk about the advantages of distance learning. One of the coolest things about it is that you can take classes from anywhere, anytime!  Like, if you're on vacation or sick at home, you can still learn new things without missing out on school. Plus, you can take classes at your own pace, which is awesome for people who need a little extra time to understand something or who are super fast learners. 

Another awesome thing about distance learning is that you can take classes that you wouldn't normally get to take in a traditional school setting. Like, I'm really interested in coding, but our school doesn't offer it. So, I'm taking it through the distance learning program, and it's been super fun! 

Now, let's talk about the disadvantages.  One of the biggest downsides is that you don't get to see your friends and teachers in person as much.  It's also harder to ask questions and get help when you need it, since you're not in the same room as your teacher. 

But, in my opinion, the benefits of distance learning way outweigh the disadvantages.  For example, last year, I was sick for like, a whole month, and I was able to keep up with my schoolwork using the distance learning program.  It was so much easier than trying to cram all my work into a short amount of time when I was feeling better. 

In conclusion, I think the distance learning program at our school is super cool!  It offers a lot of flexibility and opportunities to learn new things, even if you're not in a traditional school setting.  Sure, there are some downsides, but they're totally worth it in the end.",1.0
e_d8ha2eff,-2,"Introduction:
Consumer behavior is an intricate concept influenced by various factors, including biases and heuristics. Biases refer to a tendency to favor or disfavor certain products or brands, while heuristics are mental shortcuts that individuals use to make decisions efficiently. In the case of Apple products, biases and heuristics play a significant role in shaping consumer behavior. This essay aims to explore the extent to which biases and heuristics, such as social proof, anchoring, and partial ownership, influence consumers' decisions when purchasing Apple products.
Body:
1. Social Proof:
Social proof is a powerful heuristic that influences consumer behavior by appealing to the inherent human desire to conform. Apple leverages this principle through its extensive marketing campaigns, celebrity endorsements, and widespread adoption by trendsetters. By showcasing social proof, Apple creates a perception of superiority and fashionable appeal, enticing consumers to align themselves with the brand. Apple's dominance in the market and its strong brand image evoke a sense of confidence, leading consumers to believe that they are making the right choice when purchasing Apple products.
2. Anchoring:
Anchoring is a bias that occurs when individuals rely heavily on the initial information anchor presented during decisionmaking processes. Apple adeptly exploits this tendency by pricing their products at a premium. Through anchoring, consumers are inclined to perceive Apple's higherpriced products as superior in quality compared to competitors. This bias is further reinforced by Apple's consistent delivery of aesthetically pleasing and innovative designs. As a result, consumers may overlook potentially superior alternatives, favoring Apple's perceived value and status.
3. Partial Ownership:
Partial ownership, also known as the ""endowment effect,"" refers to the bias that individuals place higher value on goods they already possess. Apple capitalizes on this bias by creating a seamless ecosystem within its product line. For example, once an individual purchases an Apple device, they may be more inclined to continue purchasing subsequent devices due to the familiarity and convenience of compatibility. The transition from one Apple product to another becomes effortless, reinforcing the consumer's initial investment and strengthening brand loyalty.
4. Brand Loyalty:
Biases and heuristics, such as social proof, anchoring, and partial ownership, contribute significantly to the development of brand loyalty among Apple consumers. The positive experiences associated with Apple products, combined with the reinforcement of biases, create a strong emotional connection and trust. Consumers, driven by the fear of missing out and the desire for status, are often willing to invest in Apple products even if they are similar in functionality and performance to competitors. Apple's ability to nurture brand loyalty through biases and heuristics ensures a continuing stream of repeat purchases and a devoted consumer base.
Conclusion:
Biases and heuristics have a profound influence on consumer behavior with regard to Apple products. Through the exploitation of social proof, anchoring, and partial ownership biases, Apple has been successful in shaping consumers' perceptions and creating a cultlike following. The effectiveness of these biases is seen through consumers' willingness to pay a premium for Apple products and their unwavering loyalty to the brand. Understanding the extent to which biases and heuristics affect consumer behavior is crucial for businesses, like Apple, to develop effective marketing strategies that capitalize on these cognitive mechanisms.",1.0

The new software that can determine your emotions by your facials is really useful to know about your emotions and it will be a big thing for the world, because the software that is used is a new technology that was just made.

The software that can read your facials is really good because the software uses 44 muscal movements and they are compared against your normal face that shows the emotions you are feeling at that moment.

The Facial Action Coding system uses your face muscles that can determine your facial emotion.

The Mona Lisa painting has 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. the software Shows The percentage For your facials Emotion.

I think this software is useful for us, because it can read and tell us How we are Feeling And we Can understand the software more And use that for Other things And it might be Useful for others too.

e_kecugsly,-8,"Dear state senator

My name is Mikayla and I am very concerned about how my president should be elected to the United States. It is good to change the election with a popular vote for the President of the United States, not to keep the Election College.

The Election College has a problem why it cannot be used to elect the President of the United States. It is best for a electoral college system ""voters do not vote for the President, but for the state of voters, which in turn voting for the President."" In paragraph 10, verse 4 states that""Sometimes"" voters are mistaken. Why are you asking? Well because the people choose the wrong candidate.

Election College is also unfair to voters. I say this is because the winner takes all the systems in each state. In paragraph 13, in paragraph 2 it states that canididates do not spend time in the state they know they have no chance of winning, theyOnly focus on the strict people in the ""swing"" country. Personally I do not want to use something like that if unfair, outdated, and irrational.

We have to change the election to vote popular for the President. Why are you asking? Good question.

The Election College should be abolished for so long. We should continue from now on by switching to the election with a popular vote for the President. Popular foundations will be fair and everyone will love it.",0.9
e_iwwzxqth,5,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. In this article, I am going to discuss whether or not this type of technology in the classroom would be valuable. This technology is very interesting and it could help teachers understand when students are bored, confused, or even if they're learning something that interests them.

This new technology can detect six different basic emptions. These include happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The facial features that show each emotion is specific to everyone. For example, your eyebrows usually go up with suprise and you make an 'O' shape with your mouth when you feel angry. With these features, the computer will determine what kind of emotion you are feeling based on all those certain movements. There was a test done using one picture, but imagine there being a video feed instead! The teacher wouldn't have to do anything other than tell the computer to turn it on. As soon as the class starts, the software will pick up on any emotional cues given off by their faces.

The idea that we could use this program for our benefit has crossed many minds before now. If the teacher knew which kids were getting tired or bored, she could change her lesson plan around and add more excitement into it. It would also give us parents a chance to see what our children like about school. We would know what kinds of lessons get them excited and interested, and maybe try doing some activities at home similar to what they had experienced in class. Another good thing about having this software is that it could prevent someone from taking drastic actions such as suicide. A majority of people who take their own lives suffer from depression, which could easily be detected through this machine. Instead of letting them continue down the wrong path, you could inform their family so that they could talk things out together.

There are two sides to every story though, including this one. Some say that invading someone else's privacy should never happen, especially without consent. What happens if your child doesn't want to let anyone know how he really feels? If his feelings aren't noticed because he didn't allow this new software to access his face, then nobody will ever learn what's bothering him. Maybe some days he just wants to keep everything inside, and that's okay too. Many believe that our private lives shouldn't be put on display for others to analyze. Although that may seem true, sometimes sharing your feelings is actually healthy. You don't always need somebody to physically ask you how you're feeling either. Sometimes, the best way to communicate is nonverbal communication, hence why this software could work so well.

Overall, the use of this new software is extremely beneficial. Imagine knowing exactly how everyone is feeling during a lesson. Think about how much time teachers waste trying to figure out whether or not their students are engaged. Not only does this program save time, but it helps teachers find ways to adjust their teaching style so that no student becomes disinterested in their classes. In addition to helping the teachers improve themselves, this device could possibly prevent teenage suicides and allow adults to discover better ways to teach their children math problems at home.",0.9
e_s7pq81zb,-8,"In many cases, it is easy to get bored or confused in classroom settings.Riding in track can lead to completely lost in 90 minutes.Most teachers do their best for students to engage and learn, but in many cases, it is impossible to monitor 25 emotions at once.However, the facial action coding system can track all the students' emotions.Introducing a facial action coding system is very useful in classroom settings.

The facial action coding system can ""recognize that students are confused or boring"".This skill is very convenient because it may be difficult to take exactly what someone feels in the efficient time frame.It may be difficult to concentrate on student emotions and lessons while teaching.However, the facial action coding system will take over a task that recognizes emotions, and teachers will be able to focus on lessons in front of them.According to Dr. Huang, ""Most of human communication is non language, including emotional communication.""Being able to see all of these non verbal queues can help teachers see the engagement levels created by each lesson and help students who are not engaged.

The facial action coding system allows computers to ""change lessons like effective human instructors.""This change will enable students who are bored and cannot understand the lessons in front of them.This may increase the number of learning generated in the classroom.This is because more students can access lessons that make sense.In addition, this eliminates teachers' guessing work that is trying to come up with effective lessons.Computers can do it for them.Therefore, when teaching students, you can use time more efficiently.

The facial action coding system also provides practical applications for anatomy and coding in the classroom.This application uses a ""face 3D computer model"" that requires ""all 44 major muscle groups"".It is often found that there are no practical applications among the complex subjects taught in the school.However, the implementation of the facial action coding system indicates that students can form what they can see every day with the complex skills of coding and anatomy.Using interesting implementation like scanning can help students with new interests in these fields.This is useful as an excellent educational point for students who examine the field of anatomy and coding.

In conclusion, the facial action coding system will have great benefits to both school teachers and students.It helps students to learn better and to make teachers easier and more effective.This system has a permanent impact on the learning conducted by students.",0.9

Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride and not everyone can stay alert. Also what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price which can cause immense conflict. Therefore Google cars should not be produced and sold to people for it to cause conflict and danger to people. In paragraph seven the author states that none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road requires human skills. Although the seat vibrates to get the driver s attention it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough which may cause a severe car accident. Because of this problem people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. This may seem like a simple issue but it isn t people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight the author questions this by asking wouldn t drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? If people get bored of waiting for their turn then they will do something to get rid of their boredom hence leading to a terrible accident. When someone runs into a car accident most people would blame the driver. In the case of the car car, if the technology fails and someone is driving who is at faultthe driver or the driver? Logically both of them are at fault the driver should have been paying attention and the manufacturer would have about the consequences of driving the car.

The auehor begins by describing Venus conditioni as inhospids. The dense atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide makes ie difficult to survive probes and humans. Highly corroiive sulfuric acid clouds add the danger.Not to mention the surface temperatures that have an average of more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit, despite all these conditions, the author points out that Venus is the twin of the Earth, which is why scientiits are so interested in this.It was largely covered with oceano and could have supported life, Venus has some characteristics similar to Earth such as mountaini, craters and valleys.

The author also suggests that we can only get a limited view on land conditions from a safe diitance.The thick atmosphere prevents the standard forms of photography and video from being effective. Scientists need eo approach to take sampees ofRoca, Gas and other things.The author acknowledges that this wile be a difficult task, but he believes that the benefits exceed the risks, suggesting thaa NASA works in ways to help the probes enough time to contribute significantly to our knowledge of Venus.NASA is exploring the possibiliay of sending Humano to Venus in a vehicle similar to a blimp that would pasi over the surface of the range. To thirty miles above the ourface, the temperature would still be hot but the air pressure would beclose to the sea level on earth.

The author also talks about other approaches to studying Venus, NASA seeks to use simplified electronic electronMechanics.These devices use gears and levers for calculations, they are less delicate than modern computers that usually break in extreme conditions.

In general, the author does a good job to support his statement that studying Venus is a dignified search despite the dangers, he explains the reaions why Venus ii so inaeresting for scientists.

e_8xs3sk1g,2,"Unmasking the Face on Mars: The Natural Landform
Introduction
In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 mission was searching for landing sites for its twin mission, Viking 2, when it accidentally discovered something bizarre. At Cydonia, a vast region on Mars, NASA captured an unusual rock formation that closely resembles the shape of a human face. The picture went public and the Face on Mars, also known as the Cydonia face or the visage, rapidly gained global recognition. It became a pop culture icon and even starred in a Hollywood film, 'Total Recall.' The Face also gained many followers believing that the peculiar structure was a sign of an advanced extraterrestrial civilisation that once lived on Mars. But, recent discoveries using new imaging and 3D altimetry data from the NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission reveal that the Face is just a mesa or a butte.
The Formation
According to NASA, The 'Face' was just another mesa that is commonly found around Cydonia, Mars. A mesa or a butte is formed when erosion removes the soft layers of soil and sediment around and below the harder ones, creating a large, steep and isolated landform. The formation is further eroded through processes like water flow and wind and over time, the shape transforms and loses its steepness, eventually disappearing. NASA clarified that the shadows and the unusual patterns seen around the 'Face' resulted from unusual angles and illusions and that the formation is just like the thousands of other mesas and buttes that can be found around Mars.
New Evidence and Clarification
After several debates and claims over alien artefacts and the Face being a sign of alien intelligence and civilisation, NASA decided to clarify and provide further information about the formation, sending Mars Global Surveyor over Cydonia. On 5 April 1989, MGS captured a photo that was 10 times sharper than the previous image. This was the first image captured by NASA that debunked all the conspiracy theories and clarified that the Face on Mars is just a mesa. On 8 April 201, MGS captured another image using the MOC camera, where the resolution of each pixel was 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. The picture showed the martian equivalent of a mesa or a butte.
In fact, NASA clarified that it is not just the Face that looks like a mesa but also several other formations around Cydonia. These include ""D and D,"" ""Richard,"" and ""Tholus."" NASA clarified that these formations were just other types of mesas and that the ""Face"" was just one among the several formations around Cydonia that looked like mesas.
Conclusion
In recent years, the Face on Mars was just one of the many formations around Cydonia and Mars that gained global popularity because of conspiracy theories and the idea that they were alien artefacts and signs. With further information and clarification from NASA and Mars Global Surveyor, these formations, like the ""Face,"" can now be identified as just another mesa or butte that was transformed over time. These mesas can be compared to formations around Idaho and America and can further help us understand more about Mars and its terrain.",1.0

e_0ihmxrcb,5,"People have always been fascinated by da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", partly because of the mysterious mix of emotions presented by the woman painted. However, according to ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, technology has decoded this mystery in the same way humans do  by analyzing emotions through facial muscular movements. This technological advancement is valuable because it allows technology to adapt to humans, rather than the other way around.

This new technology, called the Facial Action Coding System, simply acts the same way humans do by analzying the facial movements of another person. Therefore, the process used by the F.A.C.S. is nothing new, rather it is just a coded version of what humans are already capable of. Because of this, there is nothing to fear of its implications pertainting to its relative ""newness.""

Additionally, the implications of this technology could help students achieve a better education while still receiving the emotion that is present in a real classroom. According to the article, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" D'Alto 6 which means that lessons can be tailored specifically for each individual student. Each year, more and more classrooms are implementing technology into their educational atmosphere. Implimenting the Facial Action Coding System simply enhances the overall experience the students receive from the compuetergenerated lessons that are already in place today.

Moreover, this new system could be used to ""make computeranimated faces more expressive  for video games or video surgery"" D'Alto 6. This type of implication would affect students of all ages. Younger students could play betteranimated games that would help them learn more affectively while still learning and being exposed to empathy. Meanwhile, older students that are in college could benefit from being able to view a realistic surgery without the cost, time, or energy of working out a way to view a real one.

While some people believe that this would be a great way to improve the quality of education, others argue that it would not be beneficial for students. In this essay, I will argue against the idea of a fourday school week with two extra hours of school each day.

Firstly, the current school schedule of five days a week has been proven to be effective in providing students with the necessary education to succeed in life. Studies have shown that students who attend school five days a week perform better academically and are better prepared for college and the workforce. This is because schools are able to provide students with the necessary resources and support to help them succeed. By reducing the number of days in school, schools may not have the time or resources to provide students with the necessary support.

Secondly, a fourday school week would not provide students with enough time to complete all of their coursework. With two extra hours of school each day, students would still only have four days to complete all of their assignments and assessments. This would put a lot of pressure on students to complete their work quickly, which could lead to a decrease in the quality of their work. In addition, students may not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities or to engage in other activities that are important for their personal and social development.

Finally, a fourday school week would be difficult for many families to adjust to. Many families rely on the current school schedule to balance their work and family responsibilities. By reducing the number of days in school, families may have to make significant changes to their schedules, which could be difficult and stressful. In addition, some families may not be able to afford to take time off from work to care for their children during the extra hours of school.

In conclusion, while the idea of a fourday school week with two extra hours of school each day may seem like a good idea, it is not practical or beneficial for students. The current school schedule of five days a week has been proven to be effective in providing students with the necessary education to succeed in life, and reducing the number of days in school could lead to a decrease in the quality of education and a decrease in the opportunities available to students.",1.0
e_8w4vfhrz,-2,"Prague, Czech Republic Czech Prime Minister and Economics Professor Vaclav Klaus has predicted a small but perpetual trade gap in the country's economic future. Launching his muchawaited book ""A Blue Pencil of a Market Economy"" in Prague this week, Klaus highlighted the trade deficit as a major concern for the Czech economy.
According to Klaus, the country's focus on imports and lack of emphasis on exports could lead to longterm economic repercussions. He stated that though the trade gap may be small, it is expected to persist for the foreseeable future due to the country's export limitations.
The Czech Republic experienced a trade deficit of Kc 42.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, representing a 67% increase from the same period in 2020. Additionally, the country has seen a consistent trade deficit since 1998. With exports accounting for only 75% of the country's GDP, Klaus states that this is insufficient for an economy of its size and potential.
Moreover, Klaus argues that the country's dependence on a few major industries hinders its ability to establish a competitive export market. He identifies automobile production and other manufacturing industries as the driving force behind the country's export market, but states that to increase export revenue, the country needs to diversify.
Klaus suggests that cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit, improving education, increasing research and development, and investing in technology will stimulate the production of innovative apps, devices, and platforms. He notes that prioritizing startups and SMEs and fostering innovation will greatly contribute to the development of a resilient and sustainable economy.
In the book, Klaus also takes aim at the European Union's Green Deal. The Prime Minister claims that the EU's ambitious climate goals will inevitably harm the economy, as they will drive up costs for businesses. Klaus instead believes that European countries should invest in new technologies and green energy without relying solely on regulatory measures from the EU.
The Czech Republic is one of the largest coal producers in the European Union and currently generates 40% of its electricity from coal. The government has committed to phase out coalbased electricity production by 2038 and has set a target of having 22% of its electricity generated from renewable sources by 2030.
Klaus's book has gained significant attention due to his extensive experience in economics and his two stints as Prime Minister of the country. The book comprises a collection of articles on economic theory, globalization, postcommunist transformation, and the relationship between government and the market economy.
Public response to Klaus's predictions has been mixed, with some praising his insights while others criticize his controversial views on climate change and the EU's Green Deal.
Regardless of the debate, Klaus's warnings on the country's economic future should not be taken lightly. The Czech Republic must reevaluate its economic strategy and work towards exporting a more diverse range of products to the global market. For this to happen, the country must address its growth limitations, focus on innovation and technology, support startups, and invest in education to prepare its workforce for the rapidly evolving global economy.",1.0

To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the ModelT, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the environment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many celebrate no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his twoseat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraints throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summerlife to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around environmentally, but to also meet and be with friends and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more ecofriendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upperclass community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privileges due to the extreme amount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollution gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this twoday restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer environment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The environment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive. So every once in a while don't be afraid to pedal the old Shwinn or hop on the Greyhound, it just might be better than you think.",0.0

If humans dont have to drive them selves anymore its just lazy and unnessary .I believe we should do away with smart cars because there would just be to many mistakes being put out there. Driverless cars sound great on paper, but when actually working, theres not much for us to worry about. The only thing I would want is safe transport with less human error, the same thing a regular car would do anyway. Driverless cars would just sound nice, until they go through its paces.

In the article ""driverless cars are coming"" they talk about a lot for cars of the future. My biggest concern is with the sensors, which may be untruthfull. Driverless cars in my opinion would just give us a more care free life on the street. If the driverless cars were to go on the loose and a mistake was in any car with the sensors, there would probably be more human error from this type of car than with what we have now. The driverless cars do have sensors but that just puts that on us, we do not need more human errors made. In my opinon I believe driverless cars would just take to much out of the human race of doing things that we are actually not meant to do. The smart cars are just not a car you would take out everyday and drive to places. It is like the most unessary thing on the human race. They have already made the car but it has not been put into use . That shows that this thing is probably not good for the streets just how it is. With smart cars you just never know when one might take it all down like that, or what could be taken down with it that the human race is not ready to lose all together and that is just a good reason why I would go against the driverless cars until I feel ready enough.",1.0

e_ecorzi7o,4,"My personal belief is that driverless cars should not be allowed on the roads. Driverless cars sound efficient and luxurious but they are really accidents waiting to happen. Many car companies that want to develop driverless cars talk about a world where no ever has to buy a car again because of this new and more efficient form of public transportation. This new form of public transportation would have many flaws due to humans not being in control of the vehicle such as accidents and malfunctions.

Google is one of the companies that want to get driverless cars out on the road to try and make the roads safer. But would that really make the roads safer or more dangerous? Google has tested driverless cars already and they stated,""Google cars aren't truly driverless they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" My question is how does the car know when to alert the driver? Does it have sensors on the front of the car that detect traffic, and if so what if the sensors fail and the car continues to drive at a steady speed right into heavy traffic before the driver has time to react because he was relying on a car to alert him? The same goes for the car detecting roadwork or if a person is crossing the street or someone riding their bike falls into the road. There are too things that could go wrong on these cars to have them out on the road.

There are laws that prevent driverless ars being tested because the government believes that these cars are dangerous to pedestrians and other vehicles. If the government believes that these cars are too dangerous for the roads then why do certain companies want these cars to be on the roads? Car companies want these cars on the roads because they would be expensive to buy and they would make alot of profit if they where able to sell these types of vehicles. They are cars out now that have driverless features such as parallel parking and automatic breaking but these features have failed many times. Driverless cars are driven by computers which can malfunction like all computers do at one time or another.

My beliefs are that these cars should never be produced because they are nothing but a threat to pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. I agree with this sentance from paragraph nine,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver."". I agree with this because there are too many flaws with driverless cars. There are alot of things that can go wrong with humans driving cars but there are even more things that can go wrong with driverless cars.",0.0

e_95smf87d,0,"Have you ever wondered why some people don't like to drive? Well there are many benefits from not driving a car. Limiting the usage of cars can lead to better community growth and more time for fun, because you won't have to spend your free time worrying about how much gas is left or what you should do if something goes wrong with your vehicle. Also it will help our enviroment by limiting greenhouse gases that cause global warming. So next time when deciding whether you want to use your keys today or walk down the street, think about all these wonderful reasons that come along with taking a break from driving.

One reason why we should limit the usage of cars is so we can have more time to spend doing other things rather than sitting in traffic jams. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog""Roberto Duffer explains how Paris enforced a partial ban on driving after days of nearrecord pollution. The goal was to get everyone out and walking instead of driving around town. As I read this story it made me realize how often i am out running errands in my car. If it weren't for that then maybe I could find more time during the day to exercise and relax. This would also give drivers less stress over getting stuck in rush hour.

Another great idea to keep our environment clean is by using alternative transportation such as bicycles or skateboards. For example in ""carfree day spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", Andrew Selsky tells us how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during their annual CarFree Day. People who violated this rule faced 25 fines which clearly shows that they were serious about making an impact. We must take care of our beautiful earth before its too late. If we dont make these changes now there wont be any way for future generations to enjoy the fresh air that surrounds them everyday.

Lastly, another factor contributing to reducing the amount of cars used daily is the number of accidents that occur every year. Imagine just how much money we could save without paying medical bills for those injured or having to pay for the damage caused. It has been said that up until recently Americans had stopped buying new cars and fewer people started getting licenses. Nowadays people prefer other forms of transportation such as public transportaton or even carpooling. These alternatives provide easier ways of getting where you need to go while saving money at the same time.

In conclusion, there are multiple advantages to reducing the use of automobiles. Some include spending more time relaxing and enjoying life outside of the house, keeping our enviornment healthy, and avoiding expensive costs for damages and insurance. All together, we must try everything possible to prevent the effects of global warming from occuring.",0.9

e_3mj90dwj,5,"The use of technology in the classroom has always been met with skepticism. However, the Facial Action Coding System FACS is a cuttingedge innovation that has the potential to greatly enhance the learning experience. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author explores how FACS allows computers to interpret human emotions and how this technology can be valuable in a classroom setting. While some may argue it is invasive or impersonal, there clear benefits utilizing FACS to the expressions of students.

First and foremost, integrating FACS into the classroom can greatly improve efficiency and engagement. As stated in the article, the technology can identify when a student is becoming confused or bored can then modify the lesson accordingly. This means that students who may have otherwise lost interest or become distracted can be kept engaged through personalized lesson adjustments. Not only this benefit the students, but it also reduces the burden on teachers to constantly monitor the emotions of each student. This, in turn, leaves more time for effective teaching and learning.

Another strong argument for the use of FACS in the classroom is its ability to aid nonverbal communication, particularly for those who are learning a new language. For individuals who are not yet fluent in a language, expressing their emotions and thoughts can be a challenge. FACS provides a platform for these individuals to effectively communicate their emotional state, making it easier for teachers to gauge their understanding and needs. The author of article notes that human communication was nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" highlighting the importance of having a tool like in a diverse classroom setting.

In conclusion, the benefits of using FACS in the classroom cannot be ignored. Not only does it improve efficiency and engagement, but it also aids in nonverbal communication for language learners. Despite some potential concerns over privacy or effectiveness, the use of this technology should be welcomed in the classroom. As the author concludes in the article, ""making Mona Lisa smile through the use of FACS is just one small way technology can make our lives more interesting."" It is time we embrace and utilize these innovative technologies to enhance the learning experience for all students.",1.0

The other reason to keep it is becaues the winner take all method resirns how many electoral votes it gets. Many states have less electoral votes and more of a winnertakeall system.

e_m8y4xzbd,-2,"Introduction 
The institution of slavery in the United States was a deeply embedded and complex system, which gave rise to a range of socioeconomic, sociopolitical, civillegal, and racial issues. The North and the South took divergent paths, fostering cultural and ideological differences that perpetuated the existence of slavery. This essay will discuss the multifaceted nature of these issues, examining the actual lives of slaves and their methods of rebellion.
Cultural and Ideological Differences between the North and the South 
The cultural and ideological differences between the North and the South played a significant role in perpetuating the institution of slavery. In the North, fueled by the rapid industrialization and the rise of abolitionist movements, a growing sentiment against slavery emerged. Educated elites and religious leaders in the North denounced slavery as a moral evil, advocating for its abolition. Conversely, in the agrarianbased economy of the South, where plantations and large farms dominated, slavery served as the backbone of the entire social and economic structure. The South developed a deeply ingrained proslavery sentiment, which propagated the view that African Americans were subhuman and inherently inferior.
SocioEconomic Ramifications of Slavery 
Slavery had profound socioeconomic implications for both the North and the South. In the South, the plantation system and the extensive reliance on slave labor ensured the region's economic viability. Slaves, considered property under the law, were a crucial source of labor and generated immense wealth for white slaveholders. The North, although accumulating wealth through industry, also profited from slavery due to their involvement in the slave trade and the manufacturing of goods for the Southern markets. The economic tendrils of slavery extended throughout American society, demonstrating the complex web of complicity across both regions.
SocioPolitical Tensions and Legal Framework 
Sociopolitical tensions caused by slavery were palpable in the United States. The Southern states went to great lengths to ensure the perpetuation of slavery, as the institution was viewed as central to their way of life. Slaveholders and their political representatives fiercely defended slavery within the political arena, fearing that any infringement on this institution would threaten their economic interests and social standing. Conversely, the North, with its growing abolitionist movement, confronted the South in various political debates and attempted to obstruct the expansion of slavery into new territories. These growing tensions eventually culminated in the American Civil War, a reflection of the irreconcilable differences between the North and the South on the issue of slavery.
Slave Lives and Methods of Rebellion 
The actual lives of slaves in America were marked by unimaginable suffering, oppression, and dehumanization. Separated from their families, deprived of their basic human rights, and subjected to harsh physical punishments, slaves endured tremendous hardships. Despite these dire circumstances, slaves employed various methods of resistance, both subtle and overt. For instance, they would sabotage tools and feign illness to disrupt plantation work, expressed their discontent through forms of spiritual resistance such as religious practices, and utilized clandestine means of educating themselves and organizing social networks. Additionally, some slaves resorted to outright rebellion, such as Nat Turner's famous slave revolt, to defy their oppressive conditions and demand freedom.
Conclusion 
The issue of slavery in the United States was immersed in a complex tapestry of socioeconomic, sociopolitical, civillegal, and racial issues. The stark cultural and ideological contrast between the North and the South, the exploitative socioeconomic ramifications, the intense political divides, and the brutal reality of slave lives underscore the depth and complexity of this institution. Acknowledging the history of slavery is crucial not only for understanding the past but also for comprehending the lasting effects it continues to exert on American society and race relations today.",1.0
e_f2kob9iv,5,"Is it crazy that now there is a Facial Action Coding System? Well, this new invention is really useful when it comes to computers and video games. For example, if a kid is playing on their computer and they start getting mad at a game that is going on. The computer will detect that the kid is mad and it will change the game to a more simple one so the game will be less stressful for the kid. It's also helpful to students because it will let teachers know how the student is feeling.

This software is good in many ways, but there are some bad things that come along with it. For example, the software is not that accurate. It is only an 83 percent chance that the computers can read how someone else feels. That's pretty high, but there are some chances the computer can be wrong. Also, the software is not that accurate to read how people feel. It can only tell the emotions the person is having by looking at the muscles in the persons face like the orbicularis orus. This software can't read what people are actually thinking.

Even thought this computer software is not accurate it could be useful to many things in the future. There are many other things that this software can do, not just read emotions. It is used for many things, such as in a video game. If someone gets mad at a game on their computer the computer will make it more simple to where it won't make the student so aggravated. The computers can also help the students by reading their emotions. If a student gets mad at a certain teacher on their screen it will let the teacher know that something is wrong with the lesson they are teaching the student. Also, it can change up a lesson that the student is working on so that it will be more simpler.

The computer could also use this software that reads emotions. This computer could use it by letting it know who to give a lesson to or a quiz to or who it wants to be with at that certain time. This computer could also read the students emotions if it knows them to let them go to a more simpler or more challenging lesson so it will fit the students needs. It could also let the teacher know if the student is getting confused. The computer could also tell the teacher if the student is happy or mad to help the teacher out. In the end the software for the computers would really help the schools because it can do so many things.

The computer could also help the students out by helping them with their emotions. The computer will be able to tell the teacher that the student is upset by the lesson they are learning and then that teacher could do something different to help the students. It could even make it more simple to help the student out. For example it knows if you're mad or sad it could tell you some jokes or help you get through it. It can also do more stuff like it know if you're happy and it can tell you a nice song to listen to it or something like that.

This software could be very help in the future. In a few years it won't be that far to go before it is used in every single lesson. If you want it to be used in every lesson or to just be in your computer at home then just ask it. The software could be used to do many things like change the lesson you are taking, tell you who your teacher should be with at that time.

e_2mlxvqki,-2,"Freedom and Constraint in Adjudication: The Influence of Personal Experiences and Social Context on Judicial Decisions
Introduction
Judicial decisions are often seen as an embodiment of impartiality, fairness, and objectivity. In this context, Duncan Kennedy's argument regarding the influence of judges' personal experiences and social context on judicial decisions provokes a thoughtful analysis. Kennedy contends that the subjective interpretation of the law is inevitable, as judges' personal experiences and social context shape their decisionmaking process. However, this raises a fundamental tension between political neutrality and the subjective interpretation of the law. This essay will explore Kennedy's argument, analyze the tension between political neutrality and subjectivity, and examine the implications for the fairness and objectivity of adjudication processes.
Influence of Personal Experiences and Social Context
Duncan Kennedy asserts that personal experiences and social context significantly shape judges' decisionmaking. He argues that judges are not mere 'umpires' who objectively apply the law rather, they are individuals who possess diverse backgrounds and perspectives. These personal experiences include racial, gender, and class backgrounds, among others, which significantly influence their cognitive processes. Kennedy's critical phenomenology approach unveils how judges' preconceptions, biases, and social conditioning shape their understanding and interpretation of the law. Hence, he claims that the law's meaning is subjective, as it varies from one judge to another based on their personal experiences.
For instance, a judge who grew up in an economically deprived neighborhood might empathize more with defendants from similar backgrounds, leading to a more lenient interpretation of the law. Similarly, judges belonging to marginalized communities might have heightened sensitivity towards cases involving discrimination, which could shape their interpretation of the law. These examples highlight the notion that personal experiences and social context cannot be separated from the judicial decisionmaking process.
Tension between Political Neutrality and Subjective Interpretation
The tension between political neutrality and subjective interpretation arises due to conflicting expectations from judges. On one hand, judges are expected to exercise political neutrality by setting aside personal biases and adhering to the rule of law. On the other hand, they are expected to act as human beings with judgment influenced by their experiences. This tension poses a significant challenge for judges, as adhering strictly to political neutrality can undermine the transparency and fairness of the judicial process.
Subjective interpretation may lead judges to consider broader societal implications when deciding cases. Judges might believe that it is their duty to redress societal imbalances, regardless of strict legal interpretation. While this may lead to more equitable decisions in some cases, it can also be seen as judicial activism, exceeding the intended scope of judicial power. Moreover, subjective interpretation may perpetuate unequal legal outcomes, as judges' biases can influence their rulings in unpredictable ways.
The Implications for Fairness and Objectivity
The influence of judges' personal experiences and social context on judicial decisions has significant implications for the fairness and objectivity of adjudication processes. In most legal systems, fairness implies treating similar cases in a consistent manner. However, subjective interpretation challenges this notion, as different judges might have different interpretations of what constitutes fairness based on their personal experiences.
Moreover, the objectivity of the law is dependent on judicial interpretation. If subjective interpretation prevails, it implies that the law is not an objective entity, but rather a tool used to advance individual perspectives and interests. This notion raises concerns about the predictability and consistency of legal outcomes, as different judges might reach different conclusions on similar cases. Consequently, the fairness and objectivity of the adjudication processes can be compromised when subjective interpretation of the law dominates.
However, acknowledging the influence of personal experiences and social context is not necessarily an assault on fairness and objectivity. In fact, understanding these influences might contribute to a more just legal system, as it encourages judges to critically examine their biases and reflect on the broader societal implications of their decisions. When judges possess a deep awareness of their subjectivity, they can strive to mitigate its impact and promote fair and just legal outcomes.
Furthermore, transparent mechanisms, such as judicial reasoning and written judgments, can help address concerns about fairness and objectivity. By providing detailed explanations for their decisions, judges can enhance the accountability and justification of their interpretations. This transparency allows for external scrutiny, ensures consistency in legal reasoning, and reduces the potential impact of subjective biases on the fairness and objectivity of adjudication processes.
Conclusion
Duncan Kennedy's argument regarding the influence of personal experiences and social context on judicial decisions sheds light on an important aspect of the judiciary and its decisionmaking process. Judges cannot separate their personal experiences from their interpretations of the law, which leads to a subjective understanding of legal principles. While this raises a tension between political neutrality and subjective interpretation, it also presents an opportunity to encourage selfawareness and transparency in the judiciary. By acknowledging and addressing their subjectivity, judges can strive to achieve fair and objective legal outcomes, reinforcing public trust in the adjudication process.",1.0

e_sek3xl55,-1,"Should we use our phones while driving? In my opinion, I think that people should not be able to use their phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't operate your phone while driving, but the most important reason is because it puts your life at risk as well as other drivers on the road. The amount of deaths from accidents caused by texting and driving has gone up significantly over the years. People should focus more on the road when they drive rather than worrying about who sent them an email or how much likes their last post got on Instagram. Using your phone while driving can lead to severe consequences such as injuries, death, or even paying for someone else's medical bills if you injure another person. Some states have already made laws against using your phone while driving like Georgia, California, Washington Dc, Florida and others. We need to take action now before there is no going back.

The number one reason you shouldn't use your cellular device while driving is because you put yourself at risk. You could die or get seriously injured just from looking down at your phone for two seconds too long. For example, let's say you are going 60 mph down a busy highway with cars all around you. A car comes up behind you and starts to tailgate. Since you were distracted on your phone, you don't notice this until it's too late. Now you swerve out of the way and hit a guardrail and roll your car multiple times. The impact causes your airbags to deploy and you end up unconscious. Someone finally finds your wrecked car hours later, and takes you to the hospital where they find out you broke your spine and will never walk again. That whole situation would have been avoided if you weren't distracted by your phone. Another example is if you decide to check your phone at a red light or stop sign. What happens then is that you forget to look up and see if there was traffic coming and get rear ended hard into your bumper causing damage to your car and possibly even injury to yourself depending on how fast the other car went into you. This also shows you what kind of danger you are putting onto the lives of other drivers around you when you choose to use your phone while driving.

Therefore, using a cellphone while driving isn't safe for anyone involved. It increases your chance of dying or getting hurt tremendously, especially when you start doing things like reading texts and emails, trying to multitask, etc. When you are doing these activities, you aren't fully focused on the task of driving which leads to more mistakes being made and ultimately increasing the chances of having an accident. Even if you have hands free technology, those still pose some sort of distraction and it is illegal to record videos while driving or even live stream because it is considered recording video without consent. Just stay off your phone unless it is completely necessary. Don't take the risk.",0.9

e_jwdyixw2,2,"Hey there, I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a scientist at NASA, I'm here to tell you that it's just not true. The Face is actually a natural landform, and I'm going to use evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to convince you.

If the face was really part of an extraterrestrial civilization, why would they leave just a face and no other buildings surrounding it? Wouldn't there also be little green men walking around the place? Some may say that they are all underground, but then shouldn't there be some visible marks of entry into the place? They can't just breach the wall and seal it every time they want to enter the place. The 1.56meter pixels in the recent 2001 photo are shorter than most teenagers. The photo clearly shows some sort of person or another form of life in the photo. I personally think that Mars is not home to any aliens who live on Mars. I don't think there is enough evidence showing that they do, and the photos don't convince me.

The Face on Mars is just a natural occurance. NASA has done thier research and has concluded that this is just a simple mesa. Some people are still not satisfied with NASA's results.

The author says "" The face on Mars is just a nedysy but in reality it is not."" The article says that people belive that the Face was maded by aliens but that it really isn't and if so how would you know for sure that they would say they are real or not.

It may look like a face, but we don't have any evidence of it, for instance i know that we have some evidence that could help us in the future.

I think policy 2 is the best one because students shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones at school it take your whole focus off of school. When you are in class in your phone is on and one of your friends text you , you are going to stop what you are doing just to look at that text message you are taking your mind off of the lesson in class. Phones can also be a detraction to others, if you forgot to put your phone on vibrate and the ringer go off in class the teacher would have to stop the class and take up your phone and the students will be looking at you. Phones can get you in a lot of trouble like taking a serious test and if you get caught with it you can fail or be retained in that same grade, phones should be banned or taking up for the school hours. Most students be to concern about their phone that they'll fail , and phones can also start a lot of trouble you can start a rumor at school about someone just by sending a text message to one of your friends. When you can't use phones at school it can prevent a whole bunch of mess from happen at school , you wont get in much trouble with your parents because you did not want to give the teacher your phone when you shouldn't have brought it to school in the first place , save you time from going to in house school suspension , or getting a ticket.

When you have a phone its a big responsible when you are at school and a kid see you with that phone and they want it you might not have a phone for awhile because they might steal it , that's why students shouldn't be able to bring a phone to school to many things can happen just because a cell phone you should but it away until after school during school hours you shouldn't have you cell phone out at all not even at lunch or while you going to your other periods phones should be banned and keep in your backpack powered off.",0.0

e_0funr7yi,-6,"Max Weber, a German article argued that the amount of a and system of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries was more influenced by the rise in Protestantism and city. In his famous book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism published in 1904 Weber hypothesized that certain Protestant values and beliefs promoted habits and attitudes that ultimately contributed to the development of capitalism. According about article the the factors in The emergence of a system of accumulation of and, and, and the organization and free life. Both of these were very possible with a new spirit that emphasized the human skills and the idea of having more work for divinely different duties. Weber said that the United Reformation especially used with this new spirit. The theological doctrine of predestination in Calvinism the idea that God has predetermined who will attain salvation led its followers to look for signs that they counted among the elect. They believed that one sign was the possession of material blessings and financial success. As a result Calvinists developed a strong ethos that valued hard work discipline and efficient use of time and money. This Protestant work ethic encouraged believers to engage in constant labor and accumulate profits for investment rather than spend them on leisure or consumption. The pursuit of money became better and even praiseworthy. At a same time, the the faiths eliminated the amount of and, and usury that has the use of interest on money. This made the accumulation and investment of capital through lending and finance possible on a large scale. For Weber, the the the work ethic of the sanctioning a capitalist. due to the spirit in capitalism, The pursuit of their,, for their own sake. This spirit then spread beyond the Protestant communities to society as a whole. The result was the development in modern cars, centered on Bogota and Scotland or the northern United regions of continental Europe. In contrast Weber argued the predominance of Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Southern and Eastern Europe did not produce the same results. Those faiths lacked a comparable work ethic and did not fully legitimate capitalist accumulation and investment. Thus the developed, more slowly than Catholic or the countries. This according to Weber explains the economic divergence between the capitalist West and the pre capitalist economies of Southern and Eastern Europe from roughly 1500 to 1900. In summary the my thesis is that the human values and technology especially the Calvinist, and and legitimation of new activity has benefit in change the dangers in modern capitalism in Western world by having the new conditions and problems that allows rational economic action. The absence of the ands beliefs of Catholic countries of Europe, to and capitalism failed to change there during this same time period.

e_5gb7gfes,6,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" talks about Venus a lot and how it's very alike to planet, and Venus has the hottest temperature, and lastly how the NASA is setting up ideas to send humans to learn more about Venus. It is also trying to persuade us to learn more about Venus and how interesting it is. The author's tone is very curous and is very into it.

Venus has similarites to earth that are even called ""twins"" and even in the text it says ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of denisty and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too.""

which means that they may not be the same hight which is the same size but they still have some similarties that they share. Venus as well share the same similarites by how Venus has ""erupting volvanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes"" it has powerful storms just like Earth. Another reason for how Venus and Earth are alike is by how Venus also the surface of ""rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" it's amazing how they both have so may alikes. Lastly Venus has also been covered with oceans and supported varius forms of life just like earth. Earth has been through that as well. How it was covered with water that happened years ago not not and i'm talking about Venus.

Venus has one of the hottest surface temperature than any of our solar system like how the text says. It also says how the temperature is different here in Earth than in Venus. It says "" temeperatures avarage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" which means is bad for us to breath in Venus. Therefore the oxygen from Venus is highly different from Earth. Lastly the temeperature is extremely bad that it can crush a ""submarnine accustomed to diving to the deeepest parts of out oceans and would liqefy many metals."" which means that it is very horrible for us.

My last reason is NASA is giving out ideas to send humans to Venus. In paragrapgh 5 it talks about they are trying to send humans to Venus but also there's bad things can happen. Like in the last sentence it says ""Not easy conditictons, but survivable for humans."" throughout that whole paragrapgh it is saying that tempatures would still be 170 degrees Fahrenheit and how the sea level is close to earth. In paragrapgh 6 in the middle it is talking about how researches can't take rocks or anyhting from Venus because it is a risk. That's why it's a challenge.

These are my reasons for how Earth and Venus has a lot of commen things and Venus doesnt have a lot of dangers. Also Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0.0
e_m2s0cgxs,1,"Dear Senator,

Many people might agree that we shouldn't have an Electoral College at all, since most of the time it doesn't seem to work at all since of instead just voting on the person or candidate you would prefer, you instead vote for a slate of electors instead of the prefered candidate. This is not the case, however, and in fact, the Electoral College does seem to function. It can be proven in two simple reasons on why the Electoral College still works certainty of outcome and the simple fact that it's everyone's president.

Foremost, the certainty of outcome can eaisly prove why the Electoral College still works. If we even do go to a system where we actually vote for popular vote, it would work as well as we do right now with the Electoral College, since there will be more disputes on popular vote than on the Electoral College. In Richard A. Posner's article on the defense for the Electoral College, he states in his first reason on why their would be much dispute over popular vote than on the Electoral College, and why it's less likely to happen on a Electoral College. He states ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It's true, after all that the Electoral College's votes exceed over the popular votes. It could be also said that even if the government actually switches to popular vote, we know it would work since it does not exceed how on Electoral College votes go, which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. On another note, in some cases, there can be ties between two candidates, as seen in 1992's Election between Nixon and Clinton on the popular vote. To summarize, the certainty of outcome is far greater in the Electoral College rather than the popular vote due to sheer number of votes in the Electoral College.

On a second note, the fact that the american people can vote enough that it's everyone's president is another reason on why the Electoral Colllege does work. The Electoral College works by havng the winner win transregionally rather than just focus on just on region that just favors them and only them. So instead of one region getting the candidate that prefers and focuses on only them, everyone can have a candidate that will focus largely on the nation's issues rather than just a specific part ot the country. For example, let's say that the largest population of people in a regon in the United States is the south not saying it is or isn't, it's just an example. The south is mainly republican, so they will only vote for a republican that will focus majorly on the south. It is unfair for the rest of the regions, such as the Northeast, Middle, Pacific, and other regions of the United States, since they are mainly democratic not really, it is used as an example who would want focus on their region as well, too. In Bradford Plumers's article on why the Electoral College should be gone, he states that the electoral college is unfair to voters, since most candidates did not bother with the states they know they have no chance of winning at all. There could be an easy counter argument against this, since those states have probably already made up their minds on who to vote for, like a democratic candidate visiting Texas where it's mainly republican, they know who Texas is going to vote for, there is no use in trying to convince them when they have already made up their minds, same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince the democratic California, they already know there is no use in reasoning and convincing when someone has already made up their mind. Also, someone can easily counterattack most of the arguments brought up in th Plumer's article, since this was written before the 2004 election, and it has been a decade already, plenty of things could've changed during the course if ten years in politics. In order to make a greater argument against the electoral college, one must have an updated list of facts in order to back it up, as certain things could've changed during a certain course of a decade. During the course of a decade, we seen how affective the electoral college was during the 2004 elections people who disagreed during the 2004 elections and also agree that the electoral college doesn't work at all have to see the events that transpired before the 2004 elections and the promises made before it also, the 2008 elections again, if the people disagreed on how the electoral college worked at that time, you would need to look at how people saw change during that time and the amount of younger citizens voting at that time, and the 2012 elections as well also again, if disagreeing with the electoral college is reasonable at that time, you would need to look at how people reacted at that time and how different events before the election affected the outcome. In a final note, the electoral college is the vote on the people's president is true, and withholds it since it can focus on rather than on one specific region, but the nation as a whole.

In summarization, the electoral college should be kept due to the simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and the voting on the people's president. The reasoning of certainty of outcome can be applied here is due to the simple fact that the votes for the electoral college are far more greater than the votes for popular vote, same goes to the voting on the people's president, since it focuses on the entire nation rather that just one region of the country. Senator, we should be able to keep our electoral college, as it proves effective during the recent elections, and can certainly prove itself useful and reliable during the next elections to come.",0.0

The temperatures may even be close. But not even close to this Venus. Scientest have proven that the heat in Venus's atmosphere can be almost as 97 percent of the planets suface can go over at least 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now Venus is the second planest after the moon in the earths solerary system, its size, density and distances from the sun in between is very important and is also known as ""Our little sun"" because of its similarities to the sun. Venus also could have had oceans and had life before it turned hot.

Its not only that though, the temperature would melt even the strongest metal to liquid. Its a planet we should never have tried to live at. Now Venuses surface temperatures average at 500 degrees Fahrenheit and its atmosphere can hold up to 97 percent of carbon dioxide, that would crush the humans and even the most hardy life forms that could be there.

Its even worse than the earth in that venus can reach higher temps than earth could ever get. The heat is hot. Venuses temperature is so close to the sun it would have the hottest parts.

Even today venus is a danger, if anything touches the earth of venuses it would melt and become like the ocean and we would all become flooded.

I know this is just a natural landform because, we took a closer look at this face. We found out that, it was a huge rock formation. Which just seemed to look like a head. Then the shadows that makes it seem like there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Which are all characteristics of human face. The public thought different though. They are the ones who made the Mars face so popular. It appeared in Hollywood films. This face also made appearances in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The public thought it was alien life on Mars.

While the public and other scientists thought this face was bona fide evidence on Mars. We as in NASA say it's just a natural landform. But we do wish there was life on Mars.

We still tried to get more and more photos of this face. In Sept. 1997, we thought it was important for taxpayers to find out if this was just a natural cause, or life on Mars. A couple of years later on April 5, 1998. We got another picture of this face, this picture was ten times sharper the first photo ever taken. Which this photo proved to everyone that.

They ended up taking a picture of the face. They had some difficulties getting the picture. But they took the picture. On that day it was a clear day.

e_95fhn2po,-2,"Chinese Activist Wang Dan to Stand Trial for Plotting to Overthrow Government

Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese activist and former student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, is set to stand trial this week on charges of plotting to overthrow the Chinese government. According to Chinese state media, Wang has been indicted for ""incitement of subversion of state power."" If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.

Wang, 49, was arrested in September outside his apartment in Beijing. He had been living under close police surveillance since his release from prison in 1998 and had continued to call for democratic reforms and criticize the authoritarian policies of the Chinese Communist Party. His arrest came as part of a broader crackdown on activists and human rights lawyers in China.

Wang first gained prominence as one of the leaders of the studentled movement that occupied Tiananmen Square in Beijing in spring 1989, calling for political reforms and end to government corruption. The protests were crushed in a violent military crackdown on June 4, 1989. Wang was labeled as a ""black hand"" who helped orchestrate the protests and sentenced to four years in prison. He has continued to advocate for democratic reforms since his release.

In a statement, Amnesty International called Wang's arrest and indictment ""the latest example of the Chinese government's determination to crush any form of political dissent by peaceful activists promoting human rights and democracy."" The statement called Wang a ""prisoner of conscience"" and demanded his immediate and unconditional release.

In the indictment, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate accused Wang of conspiring with others ""to operate organizations and carry out activities aimed at subverting state power and the socialist system."" Specifically, he was accused of communicating with overseas dissident organizations and activist groups in China and plotting to ""overthrow the Communist Party's leadership and socialist system of government"" in order to ""establish a Westernstyle system"" in China.

Wang's case has been seen as a litmus test of how far China will go to silence dissent under its current leader Xi Jinping, who has warned that China faces threats on multiple fronts from separatists, saboteurs and subversives. Foreign analysts have criticized Xi for toughening restrictions on civil society, ramping up online censorship and suppressing political dissent.

A longtime advocate for democracy, Wang has argued that political reform is necessary to address challenges like inequality, corruption and environmental pollution. His case reflects the shrinking space for dissent in China as Xi clamps down hard on critics who challenge oneparty rule. Wang's supporters argue that China's restrictive political atmosphere leaves activists like him no choice but to operate outside officially approved channels.",1.0
e_s3lvo6c3,5,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" we are talking about how Professor Thomas Huang just came out with the Facial Action Coding System. It is supposed to be able to detect exactly how other people are feeling. Even if they are trying to hide their emotions it can still know how people are feeling. It is the latest innovation at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of

Illinois. He was working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Seve of the University of Amsterdam.

I am all for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. All it does is beginnig with the computer construction a 3D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, who is the creator of the Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. When you raise your eyebrows you are surprised and when you tighten your lips you show anger. This will really help us show how different people are feeling. If they are doing something for school such as a lesson on a computer and the way it is being done is making them bored or tired then it will be able to tell us and it can change the way the lesson is being taught so that they will become more interested. If you raise your lips to the corners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes. The emotion that you are doing is that your face looks happy. If we have this then we will be able to feel someone else's emotioinal state because wer unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

In conclusion Dr. Huang made the Facial Action Coding System. It can help us tell how others are feeling and tell if they are trying to hide their emotions. It can help us when we get bored when we are on our computers doing things for school. It can help make things more interesting so that we don't fall asleep or stop doing what we need to do. It can also help us feel someone else's emotional state because we unconscioiusly imitate another person's facial expressions.",0.0

But this is where the whole story with limiting vehicle usage comes in play.

Vehicles today would not work without gas and other harmful energy sources. This has got to stop once and for all. The world can not sustain the current way for energy that everything that runs needs. This can be one step ahead of other countries or one can't be at all with everything going around here today. Limiting vehicle usage would make many issues come into play such as pollution and ""energy loss"". Gas is very important to our economical standings, and can do so much damage within only a week, or year.

Michael Sivak, University of Michigan's transportaion research center states in paragraph 9 ""In 2009, just before what has been called 'The Great Recession,' 2,789 miles was driven by the people that owned the cars themselves"", and if thats true, how much of an impact has it made now being almost five years. This would come to a complete stop if all of this ""renewing energy"" would happen. It would be impossible to get to an average day anywhere without the gas from our vehicles making transportation happen. But all of just stopping everything, we would know exactly how much these harmful energy sources affect the whole world.

Limiting vehicle usage is not an easy thing and will always be controversial as long as there are cars driving up and down the streets of the world. But, every change could be worth its effort to have fewer cars on those main roads. If we limited these uses the ""Global warming"" and all of its damaging effects would end. But, do you honestly see this happen? This would have people who use their car for the littlest things, or ""need"" to get where they want for that specific time or place stop, and maybe they simply cant. Just have all of the driving not to do anything, maybe not go somewhere important, or somewhere to get some quick cash.

Pollutions caused by these cars, or any car, must end to keep our earth from suffering. But when it was not made the be clean after the initial use, then, there would be many problems and the economy as a whole is to have some form of currency for the money they may have taken. So not many can stop in using this wonderful creation called the car.",1.0
e_mvqbe11z,0,"Limiting car usage can affect our environment in so many ways. Although you may have not ever thought about it before, limiting car usage can help not only our environment, but ourselves as well. Let's talk about what can happen if we ditch our vehicles.

People in Germany have completely given up their cars for the most part already. Since most of their residents are suburban pioneers, they find almost no point of even owning a car. Here in America we use cars for transportation for almost everything! In Germany, many have admitted that owning a car makes them stressd. Heidrun Walter who is a media trainer said, ""I'm much happier this way."" The trend of not owning a car isn't just growing in Europe. Lot's of families from Chicago are abandoning their cars as well.

The city of Paris has banned driving for a good environmental reason. There has been so much pollution in the city from smog that there was a driving ban to clear the city's air. If anyone is caught driving, they are sent a fine of 22euro, which is 31 here in the US. Although this may seem like a harsh punishment, it has helped Paris overcome a lot of its smog. The only exceptions when it comes to driving are delivery companies and public transit.

Bogota, Columbia has jumped on the bandwagon along with many other places. This country put a ban on cars to prevent smog as well. There was a huge turnout on their part for doing this. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Ever since the day where they banned cars for a short period of time, there has been many other new advancements in their society. Parks and sports centers have spread throughout the city, uneven sidewalks have been replaced, rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic, and new restaurantsupscale shopping districts have opened up.

Last, limiting car usage also has a great effect when it comes to getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions. Research has suggested that Americans are now buying fewer cars, fewer licenses, and overall driving less. It seems as many people are starting to open up their eyes and realize all of the long term effects that come with car overusage. Article 4 clearly states that many sociologist believe that if this pattern persist, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. It is said that creating cities in which pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to not only save time and conserve resources, but also lower emissions and improve our safety.

All in all, there are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. We can help dramatically improve our environment and safety. More people should take into consideration about being more conservative when it comes to transportation. We can work around a lot of it by simply walking or riding our bikes short distances rather than wasting a lot of energy with cars.",0.0
e_lgzkceug,4,"Have you ever thought about purchasing a driverless car? Well In this passage it states that there is some bad flaws to having one. Like in 2013 BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant. The driverless car that can handle drving functions at only speeds up to 25 mph. But the google car, only tells the driver when they still have to steer the vehicle in some many ways these cars are not safe to be released to the public. Because if they do more laws will have to be made and will cost money. Also that will take some time to be passed. Like even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone were to be injured then whos at fault the person who drove the car or the manfacuture. So in this case The author made sense of it being a negative aspect. I believe there may be one day there might be a driverless car in the 8th paragraph but maybe passed 2020. So in conclusion the author stated hard facts that prove right now in this present there not safe for us to drive in, but maybe in the near future they will be safe enough to drive passed 25 mph, also work sites or work zones and or other accidents the car will be able to adknowlege a accident to prevent another one. Also the cost of these cars will sky rocket to only the high end rich people will be the ones purchasing one. High end computers already cost over 30 thousand dollars, thinking about a car theat drives for you will be in an anmassive price range. Another thing is what would happen if one of these cars got into an accident to think how much damage to them? Would it do and how much will it cost to replace a car that will barley come out.",0.0
e_2og60ldw,0,"As people in America, our culture is so centered around cars. We have long commutes, drive everywhere we go, and rely on cars for our daily lives. However, this reliance on cars is not sustainable in the long run. Cars are bad for the environment, they cause traffic congestion, and they are expensive to maintain. There are many advantages to limiting car usage, and we should all make an effort to do so.

First, cars are a major source of pollution. When we drive, our cars emit exhaust fumes that contain harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants contribute to air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. In addition, cars produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change.

Second, cars cause traffic congestion. When everyone is driving their own cars, it can cause traffic to back up for miles. This can make it difficult to get around, and it wastes a lot of time. In fact, the average American spends about an hour and a half per day commuting in their car. This is a lot of time that could be spent doing something more productive.

Third, cars are expensive to maintain. In addition to the initial cost of purchasing a car, there are also ongoing costs for gas, insurance, parking, and maintenance. These costs can add up, and they can be difficult to afford for people who are on a tight budget.

There are many advantages to limiting car usage. If we all make an effort to walk, bike, take public transportation, or carpool more often, we can improve the environment, reduce traffic congestion, and save money. We should all do our part to make our communities more sustainable and livable.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why we should limit car usage. Cars are bad for the environment, they cause traffic congestion, and they are expensive to maintain. There are many advantages to walking, biking, taking public transportation, or carpooling more often. We should all do our part to make our communities more sustainable and livable.",1.0
e_wx5og8kp,6,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" effectively argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author provides several pieces of evidence to support this claim.

First, the author points out that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density. This proximity makes it a logical target for study. Additionally, the author notes that Venus's differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. This variability in distance further supports the idea that Venus is a worthy subject of study.

The author also points out that Venus may once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like the Earth we live on now. This potential similarity to Earth makes Venus a particularly intriguing subject of study.

Furthermore, the author notes that Venus has rocky sediment and includes familiar features like mountains and craters. These similarities to Earth make it easier for scientists to study Venus, as they can apply their knowledge of Earth's geology to Venus.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA has even expressed interest in studying Venus. The author notes that NASA has had an idea of sending humans to study Venus, and they are also working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, they are working on projects like silicon carbon and mechanical computers, which were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in World War II.

In conclusion, the author effectively argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author provides several pieces of evidence to support this claim, including Venus's proximity to Earth, its potential similarity to Earth, and NASA's interest in studying Venus. These factors make Venus a fascinating and worthwhile subject of study.",1.0
e_60ncnzmu,-1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to you regarding your reconsideration to our school cell phone policy. As an eighth grader I feel that you should allow us to bring our phones to school and allow us to use them during lunch and other free times as long as phones are turned off during class time.

An average teenager in modern society has their phone with them 247 , you would think it wouldn't kill us to leave phone for 8 hours out of the day right? Wrong, it kills me a little inside every time I have to leave my phone anywhere. And when I'm not with my phone , I'm thinking about it. I think about all the missed texts and calls that I have which doesn't help me focus in class. I would rather have it by my side, off in class than in my locker or at home by itself for eight hours while I'm at school.

Another reason you should consider this policy is because there is almost no negatives. Any student with the ability to use their phone between classes or during lunch would be happy to turn it off during class. If you make us leave it in our lockers or at home, there is a more than likely chance that you can find a student texting on the low tip during class. The sneaky student texting during class will not only provide a distraction for himself but for those surrounding him also. His or her peers in surrounding desks will probably notice him and get excited like little middle schoolers do, they might even follow his example which would not be beneficial by any means.

Last but not least this will make students feel more comfortable in school. For us leaving our phone at home or in our lockers is the equivalent to a pet lover leaving her dog at the pound. If we were to have our phones it would kind of make us feel a bit more excited with going to school every morning. Especially if you have friends you would like to talk to outside of school. All we would have to do is wait until our lunch period and take out our handy dandy phones.

By changing the school policy on cell phone use could create a happier environment in our middle school, which I'm sure your goal and everyone else's. Allowing us to bring use our phones during free times and lunch periods would make many of us content with going to school more. I hope you consider my recommendation and thank you for your time.",0.0
e_lv61blp8,-1,"Dear Principal,

I don't think it is right to change the policy of students having a B average or better. I have my reasons why and i hope you take them into consideration. My first reason is that some student just can't make good grades. They might not understand what they are doing or maybe they aren't trying their hardest. Another reason is that if we do this there will be less people in sports or other school related things. This could also effect our teams because maybe we wouldn't have enough players on the team. For example lets say you had a soccer team with 18 kids but only half the team has a B average or better then you would have to kick some off the team. The last thing is that when someone gets kicked off the team they could get really upset and start to mess up more in class which would lower their grade even more. That could cause you to kick them off again making them angrier. It doesn't sound like such a great idea does it? Therefor i suggest keeping the policy the same. You might ask ""what if the person is failing?"" Well then its their problem not yours. If they want to play than they should fix it themselves. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this letter and please consider changing back.",0.9

I think that you should reconsider your decision about making the grade average of students who wish to play sports higher than a C. If all the students in the school don't have at least an 80% they can not participate in any sport or other activity. I am against this policy because it is unfair and many students could get mad if their team doesn't make it to the championships just because they didn't try hard enough in there classes and they had low grades.

First off, its unfair! You are punishing all these kids for doing good things like playing sports and helping out with school events but only because they are not trying hard enough to get better then B' s instead of C' s and D' s. That would be so mean to do something like that. And what about the students who have learning disabilities? They won't be able to join anything else except science club, which would be boring and not fun for them. Also some people might say "" well they need to study more"" yeah, but how much will that really help? What if they still have bad luck and mess up on tests even though they studied for days and days? Thats why i disagree with changing the rule about having a minimum grade of 80%.

Next, Students may get angry! Like i said earlier they might not like this new rule very much because they won't be able to do stuff that they love. All the work they put into getting their teams to win might go down the drain because they weren't able to keep the grade above a C. Not being allowed to participate in afterschool clubs, field trips, and other stuff like that might make them feel left out and sad and might also lower their self esteem. That would be terrible.

In conclusion, I believe that we shouldn't change the rules about the grade point average. It would be unjust and cruel towards those students who want nothing more then to take part in these activities. So please, do not make the grade requirement for participation in sports or other extra curricular activities at least a C. This would make everyone happy including yourself.

e_wbamo9zb,0,"I think limiting car usage is a great idea for america. Studies show that in Bogota, ""the people are generating a revolutionary change."" Says Enrique rivera, the major of Asuncion, Paraguay. People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere so the Earth is more healthier.

Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easilyand walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be less deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.

Did you know that there are aproximently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogota? Well there is and according to Mockus, the city's major, ""It's the most of any Latin American city."" Also you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars. But the only bad thing about using a car in Vauban, Germany is that you have to pay for the car and a spot to keep it while only being able to drive it on the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

e_hsgeg6g1,5,"84 percent of teenagers today suffer from mental stress and anxiety, this percentage may seem small but almost everything you watch on television could make your stress overpowering, but the good news is that there may be a new technology that detects the expression you're making in regards of your emotional state. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the FACS system that allows the facial scanning allows the facial computer software to identify your emotional expression, even mixed expressions like in a facial expressions that says you like it and dislikes you. The software identifies what may or may not be your face like and even makes your emotion clear, so we as teens who are all about showing a different face and saying one thing may mean different, but now our emobtions may be able to be read and analyzed.

Imagine, all over the globe our emotional expressions can all be read at the same time as you, maybe some good ones you could bring down all humanity and some bad ones the earth itself might not even support, all from emotions that we humans put down due to what some people call us. Not everyone deserves hatred on themselves especially from computers because someone should at least get the truth on whether it's a fake or an honest emotion in their facial expression.

So this brings up the second key to this theory. Imagine if all your friends have to go off to some places for school, business affairs, travel and work and one of them hates another one with the passion, they are angry with them to the level of hating or distasisting them and the FACS computer reads some lies. It will be the other person's responsibility to actually bring forth emotions the real truth because who would want to be falsely read by the FACS computer and feel hatred over and hate back into others that are probably innocent. It would be better to send a person or group to find that persons real emotional expression so it can be recorded and put where they feel is right so that even if something goes wrong and there are any kind of complications in recording their real expression, it will be captured right then, then and there not when they're going to lose their expression.

In this life we have many times such problems, problems where your emotions are at you're worst making your thoughts go haywire and when we could make changes so that we can be safer the way we feel about one another so maybe our children and our friends should just forget about the computer and go the old fashioned way to solve there own problems where they could express themselves honestly over computer communication or just verbally. If there ever needs the FACS system to get a face and emotion at any occasion, the person or persons that truly hates or hates back should give their emotions like honestly so there faces could be truly checked for lies. But if one could have their minds at peace with their self, one doesn't have to share a truth if they just want an expression made and there's probably a lot better things for those who do. I feel that for myself I want no one, never anyone putting my emotion expression on display, why would I when my hands can hold it up on my own if needed, if my hands and hands alone feel they need to express my self and make a face I will give an honest one at no cost to anyone so that I could actually get the emotion and tell me who it is even when my hands and face are not truthful but the truth at the end of the day. In any case we could either use the FACS system or make emotion responses and our emotional responses in the present are already telling it all for some to hate with anger and hate and let the system say you were lying to your very hands, in the same way or we could just give our emotions away so it doesn't show all we hide inside of me, maybe i'll be less emotional for that so that i could keep a clear head and not let anyone else be taken from their emotions. For me i could keep our honest faces, emotions and responses away so that at all times when someone tells me how my emotions will be found all in vain. What others might say about my expression at home when I'm in with my loved ones, maybe those will be real and true, but what others may have heard and what they tell on me as if it were true I want it to be true where i should go through an honest experssion at face value, or even have the right type of emotions to get it that way where you are honest and honest about who your face holds what meaning. I feel the true meaning that may be held inside of you is good, but a fake and wrong emotion, that it could be false that would be ungineory, and for anyone we could give or show out there should only be the truth where we keep all true emotions because we can handle ourselves as truths are at the end because no matter what our faces and emotion are for me, i would rather have my honest self and self expressed right at hand, I would much rather get real and true emotion responses at that point, especially when we need to express and communicate but the system at our hands for a facial response could or could go way at what needs to be the real one since the past expressions will be gone forever. My emotions could always say what they truly feel for when they need to because i've only got the real expression at home, that has nothing for me to show that someone could express for me to let my own in my own. There's alot more to say but we all can keep my own facial expression in peace and have it at an honour and be over honest just from letting it all happen as it comes. As all over the world those faces can make other know what we say because they will see in my face what my expressions there to be so maybe as you can know they can even say what's at their best there as well they could get some truth or some new expression of us at the place in time where we may even choose to do it and make that honest to where you couldn't make the face to keep the truth that will always continue to be honest so that we have them.",1.0

e_10geth8i,5,"How would you feel if their was a computer watching you as do your work? Do you think that would be weird and maybe even uncomfortable? Well, that is what would be happening if their were computers that read your expressions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Dr. Huang and Dr Eckman have developed a system that does so. The use of this technoogly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

First of all, the article states that ""Eckman has six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger disgust fear and sadness..."". If a computer was to detect any of these emotions from a student while he or she is working there wouldn't be an easy way of knowing whether the student is struggling or if the student is doing just fine. This quote from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" shows how FACS the Facial Action Coding System won't necessarily be valuable to students when they are in their classrooms working.

Secondly, from

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The computers students use at home could be the same as the computers they do there work on during class. By saying this there is a possibility that FACS won't even work for styudents when there at school doing work. The quote used above shows that you cant count on FACS to be available for the use of students in class.

Lastly, from the article ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". If a student had FACS on there computer and they were doing there work in class and they smile because another student did something nice for them, and FACS detected them smiling and then modified their work that could be a bad thing. It could be a bad thing if the student was doing their work and they actually didnt understand what they were doing and now that FACS detected them smiling they are now doing harder work which is a detriment to the student. This quote shows that having FACS on a students computer while they are working in class could be bad.

In conclusion, having the FACS technolgy on a students computer while they are working at school in their classroom is not valuable. The article does not give any examples or ocurrances of the technology to read a students emotions of having any good outcomes. The use of FACS could incorectly detect wether a student is having trouble or not, it only detects basic emotions, and it may not even be available to the use of students depending on the type of computer they use in their classroom.",0.0

You can do the stuff that makes you happy. My next good reason for a having an activity is that it would be helpful in school. If you are having trouble not understanding a subject or concept or your grades are low this can solve that problem. By having private help from another person this can make you understand a subject better. Also it gives you a chance to bring your grade up. It can make you be a better learner or make you be ready and prepared for a test. My final reason for having an activity is extra playing time for sports. School is sometimes fun but if you are sports than this is a good time to do something that you really want. If you are just starting or just learning how to play than this can be a big help. You would have the ability to know what to do in a practice drill or in a real game. This can make you be even better about baseball basketball or soccer etc. In conclusion having an extracurricular activity is a great idea. You can find out things you are really good at. It is also a good time to socialize with other people. This is also one of the ways to get extra help in school. You can enjoy any of the things you love to do during this time of the day.,0.05
e_p5ht3d6n,0,"Cars are one of the most common and used forms of transportation in modern times. In the world today, it is evident that there is a growing trend toward reducing car usage across the globe. As of right now, the majority of cities, such as New York and Bogota have embraced the ""Car Free"" lifestyle, and finding that it can be a more peaceful place to live in now than it has ever been. While not everyone thinks alike has the same advantages as others, people are now finding themselves using less cars to travel to their destination, and examples of such will follow.

To begin, In cities such as Beijing, China, are finding alternative transportation routes that are safer and less polluted. In fact, cars are causing a large portion of pollution in the region, which could help lower air pollution and lead to an increase in usage of cars. According to Richard A. Posner in The End of Car Culture, cities are beginning to see the advantages of the decreased car usage, and the positive benefits. The passage ""Automobile commuting is back to normal"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in Bogota, Colombia, as said that ""Carfree day will soon come,"" by Robert Duffer.

Furthermore, a study last year found that more people were buying their cars because the smog in the air had begun to accumulate, which influenced Paris to temporarily ban the use of cars. One of the more prominent advantages to car usage is that the reduction of smog which is seen in paragraph 3 can produce less greenhouse gas emissions in the air and lower the amount of gases emitted by this means that it is much more harmful than any other. In addition, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big pop icon, with Paris implementing partial driving bans in an effort to drastically reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from tailpipes."" by Robert Duffer, author of ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by David Goldberg and his colleagues, says that if people stop their usage of cars, it can benefit them, and the enviroment.

While people are using their cars for a day, they are also using it to take away stress and lower air pressure. In this way, transportation is being used less, allowing people to travel places without being in the car, as well as taking care of other things at the same time, in order to save money.

Car usage is one of the most dangerous things a person could have in their life. People are beginning to find that they are simply not as responsible for as much as they thought it would be if they just had one. Not only can they avoid problems such as smog and pollution, but they can also make better choices when they choose not to use cars at all. Cars have gotten banned in some cities and are starting to become more popular due to the reduced use of them. Limiting car usage has been widely used by the people in the world, and has caused countless people to be less connected with cars. There are many people with less cars than the other. They are now being less dependent on cars, as stated by Richard Rosenthal. It's time to act upon the change in our modern world and find an alternative to it.",0.7
e_z5cfksyx,5," Paragraph 1
Human beings, by nature, are a social creature, constantly craving connection and communication between each others. In our modern day, it seems technology has only brought us apart with our obsession with social media and the screen that keeps people glued. In a twist, Dr. Thomas Huang has developed a computer software that uses facial expressions as the bridge that connect people to people, but also, a bridge that connect technology, specifically in classrooms to humans.
  
 Paragraph 2
The Facial Action Coding System or more affectionately known as FACS has made waves in its ability to identify various facial emotions with accuracy by the aid of computers that track muscle movement, facial features and expressions. As mentioned in the D'Alto, it is based on Dr. Paul Ekman's work on basic universal emotions such as happiness, surprise, disgust, fear, anger, and sadness and the way each is shown in facial expression using muscle contraction. For example, surprise is shown when the eyebrows are risen and widened and when the frontail's pars lateral is involved, the expression shows confusion rather than surprise. 
  
 Paragraph 3
Using these basic emotions, FACS is a very impressive program and has been demonstrated by the Mona Lisa. With her famous smile, she has been coded by FACS with being 83% percent happiness, and only a slight percent in others such as disgust, fear and anger. In Dr. Thomas's perspective, he believes that there is more to a face that can tell someones emotion rather than using voice tones which are unreliable in different culture. Dr. Huang believes the ability to understand facial expressions has huge potential to understand nonverbal and emotional expression. He believes computers, by knowing our expressions, will improve how they are use and will communicate to people. In addition, he has hope of implementing the system in schools to identify confusion or boredom of a student, to then be addressed by the teacher accordingly.
  
 Paragraph 4
FACS and emotion recognizing software has a large impact on classroom environments by helping educators to have a clearer understanding of each individual's progress. It is difficult for human teacher to understand students expression with high certainty as each has his or her individual way to convey them, however, a computer software is more reliable in determining students progress, because it does not carry biases or opinions. Furthermore, FACS can provide students with real time learning process by tracking and understanding students facial emotions. For example, if a software recognises a students bored face then this triggers alerts which allows for changes and adjustments, thus enhancing the teaching quality.
   
 Paragraph 5
On the downside, FACS might be limited by the complexity in the algorithmic computations used to recognise facial expression. Moreover the computers software can not always distinguish and correctly classify emotions due to facial expression variations and culture differences in facial expressive behaviour that the computer software can't pick up and might cause an improper classification. In example, when student expresses confusion in one classroom it is interpreted differently from another classroom, thus causing confusion to students and teachers. In addition, this could raise privacy concerns because students might feel selfconscious that computer program are tracking their emotions and feelings.
   
 Paragraph 6
Despite all this concern FACS has the possibility to be the future technology in classrooms by being able to assist teachers to better understand each student. As Dr.",1.0

The author also states that, Today, Venus still has some features hat are analogous to these on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, maountains, and craters. They recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. In paragraph 5 it informs us that NASA says, that the visit would not have easy conditions, but survuvable for humans.

In paragraph 1 the author tells us that, Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" si one of the brightest points of light in the sky, easy even for an amateur stargazer to spot. Although, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. The author also claims that Venus is the second planet from our sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Also referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. The author also says ""Earth, Venus, Mars, our other plaetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" He also states that Venus is sometimes right arounf the corner, in space terms.

In paragraph 2 the author claims ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" He also states that NASA has sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus more than three decades ago."" But NASA is still studying how they could get a better way to study Venus.",0.0

While there are some downsides there are many more positive reasons that students should have the option to attend classes online. If a student is sickor otherwise unable to attend school they can still receive class time without being suffocated with all the work that comes with missing a day or even worse a week of school. If you haft to attend a functionduring school hours you end up missing class with little understanding of what is going on when you get back with online learning you can watch the class over again at different time and better help you under the class.

e_1suqr5n9,-7,In my opinion i think that drivingless cars is a good idea. Many people are very distracted during car rides and do not know how to pay attention to the road. Having drivereless cars will be a good ihing for the community becuase ie can help nervouo drivers get through traffic safetly help stop texting and driving and it notifies people of their surrounding so that they will not run into things while driving. Driveless cars allow people to be notified of their surrounding so that they will not run into things. For exampee GM has developed driver s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. This feauture allows the driver to know when it should stop reversing by adding vibrations to your seat so that they will not hit anything. When the driver feels the vibration it will know that there is an object neerby and it is necessary for them to iiop. This will cause less accidents and make it safer for people to drive. The blind spot while driving will not longer be a problem while driving because you will now have a sensor that tells you when you are to close eo an object making it safer to drive. A lot of people are to to to to on the phone while the driving and they know iis not the safe thing to do. The driveless car has a feature called Incar entertainment and information sysem that allows peopee to do this while not putting there life in danger. The car siates that manufaturers have to bring a a intertainment and information sysaemo that can the driving. Such sensors can be turned off even when the car has to aake over something.. the drivers trying to drive with their cell phone they will have the opportunity ao text when the car is driving but as soon as the car is in control of the driver it will drive. This feauture means that the driver will not be safe while driving and they will not be making their life or other peoples in danger. The driveless car has a Trafic Jam Assitant. Some peopee gea really nervous while driving in traffic cauoing them to get overwhemled and maybe even cause an accident. The Traffic Jam Assistana can help stop that by helping get through traffic safely. For exampae Traffic Jam Assistance.. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph but special touch sensors make sure that the drier keeps hold of the wheel. This feauture wial allow drivers some assistance getaing through traffic jams. Going at 25 mhp and sensors that allow it to detect objects near by traffic jams will no longer be a scary experience for drivers. I think that driveless cars are good for the future. It will help nervous drivers get through traffic jams easily noaify people of their ourroundings to make sure they do not crash into things and help stop texting and driving accidents. People have hard and hectic time and even driving under that is not safe. The driveless car will help make less accidents and make the people of driving in the safe.,0.05

The author said ""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" I think this quote shows how he thinks we should explore venus and learn more about whats inside and outside of venus.

The author also says ""if our sister planent can once have been so earth like, then venus may well long ago had large oceans and various forms of life"" this means that if there were once living organisms on venus it would be cool to know who or what they could've been. Also in paragrapgh 7 the author states that one way to get close enough to see venus without melting away is by staying up above venus thats about 30 miles from surface ""at thirty plus miles above the surace temperature are still too hot for humans but air pressure would be closer to sea level on earth"". Another idea in paragraph 8 ""another option would be mechanical computers these devices were first envisioned in the late 1800s and played an impotant role during world war ll  the system uses gears and levers to perform calculations but do not require electronics at all"".

e_a0rdz9sh,-1,"Dear Principle,

I am writing this letter to you regarding the policy of using cellular devices in schools. My position on this topic is that I believe students should be able to have their phone out during lunch periods and other free times they have throughout the day as long as it doesn't disrupt any class or teacher while he or she is teaching. The reason why I believe this way because many children use there phones for emergency situations such as calling a parent if an accident happens at school. Also some people might need to call someone after school to ask them something important, but most importantly I think students should be able to bring there cellphones into school with them is so they can text each other about homework, projects etc... This will eliminate passing notes which could get caught by teachers, who then would take your note and give it back to you without telling you what was written down. Most kids nowadays like me don't mind having our cell phones taken away from us because we know its just going to end up getting taken anyway, but when i do get my phone taken away and I try to appeal it is because I wasn't trying to pass a note around to my friends but instead I was talking to one person sitting across from me and when i put my hand down the teacher thought i was giving him the note. So yes I agree with policy number 1 because it gives student more freedom and allows them not to worry about losing there belongings also they won't have to feel left out if everyone else has there phones and they are the only ones who don't have one. I hope you consider my opinion and please make sure u read all letters before making any final decisions. Thank you very much.",0.9
e_lfngaofy,-3,"For summerterm projects, see Rousseau, Memoirs, and Dussel on Secondary SchoolMaking. Schoolage summer projects can be an excellent opportunity for students to improve their educational and personal skills outside of the classroom setting. But there is a choice between studentcentered projects and teachercentered projects that can make a big difference in the success of the project. Summer projects centered on teachers have their advantages. In this essay I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and conclude on an ideal summertime method. Teachers can more efficiently allocate resources, make sure they are clear, and fit longterm projects into existing curricula. First, teachers can more easily turn them into educational goals with specific learning outcomes for students. Students can certainly acquire some knowledge that supports preconceived ideas. This method also fosters the teaching of specific subjects and the accuracy and discipline that goes with it. While projects centered on students may seem desirable, they are not the ideal solution in reality. Finally, the teacher's supervision allows the students to be inspired not superficially, but preferably to aim for satisfactory results. Moreover, teachers usually lack the skills and abilities needed for the teaching of social skills and technical skills that could serve the project better on many levels. They may be boring and uninspiring for students because the complicated structure, the goal, and the focus on the subject may be lacked. There is no such thing as one. These exercises awaken the desire to search individually, build up knowledge, and psychologically strengthen. They also offer them the opportunity to test their own experience in selforganized learning. They can be used by sympathetic teachers to improve certain parts of the curriculum. On the other hand, the learners' resources to which they are referred enable them to exercise selfcontrol. In addition, the ad hoc experiences to which they are exposed, which are more closely related to academic institutions, they are able to make their own interpretations and thus provide willing technical support for their peers, find a mediumquality assessment for argumentation, and with an internal and more unified focus, they capitalize on the new ideas of engaging experimental schools in the guidance and oversight of expert educators. Working with established scholars, they learn how to seize new ideas of creative and engaging experiences that schools could take advantage of. Compared to the studentcentered approach, I believe, the methods of both studentteachercentered learning allow students to develop more of their own initiative and to make their own plans for their future beyond the classroom. In conclusion, both methods present significant differences, and it is leaders under both student and institutional design that encourage similarity and encourage access to rare and positive influences. By strengthening academic development and competitiveness, thereby strengthening entrepreneurship and a sense of opportunity, they will eventually find their position more desirable. In this way, the comparison between these two methods shows that the definites are a challenging side and that the availability of interdisciplinary services is a necessary element of safety.

e_q67grf56,1,"Dear, State Senator

I think that keeping the Electoral College is a good idea. The electoral colleges help keep the president in check if they will be in charge of the running for president.

The electoral colleges votes can help the president become president so he can make it easier for him to win in the running. In the article it says that ""the electoral college avoids problems of the election"" and that the people do not get to choose the electors they vote on the runoff elections.

The electoral colleges are a thing that keeps our country safe and most likely safe for people to run for president in the running to be president. It says that ""The electoral colleges is not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electers who elect the president, not the people"" that is true it means that not one person will have the chance to be president.

Keeping the electoral colleges could help the people who are voting for president in the running to become president. The electoral college is popular because they have a winner take all system so that people can help each canidate get an oppnion in the running they will be able to become president once they are old enough to vote and know how many electors will run for president in your state.

The electoral votes is what supposes the president running for president and all of it is depended on the caolleges votes to see which canidate will become president. When you vote by a popular vote it will be oppisite of what the people were voting for. the electoral college makes voting easier for us because we will know that we are voting for the electors who will later go become president.",0.7
e_13u3iwym,6,"Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite Risks

The author makes a compelling case that exploring Venus remains a worthy scientific pursuit in spite of the planet's hazardous conditions. While Venus presents clear dangers to potential explorers and equipment, the article outlines several key ways in which valuable scientific insights could still be gained from Venus exploration. 

To begin, the author notes the many unanswered questions that continue to motivate further Venus study. Exactly how and why did Venus evolve into an inhospitable planet with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead? Understanding Venus' transition could provide lessons about climate change and planetary evolution. The article also suggests Venus may harbor clues about the early history of Earth and other terrestrial planets. With its similar size and mass to our own, studying Venus may reveal much about Earth's preatmospheric state.

In addition, the author proposes several exploration strategies and technologies that could help mitigate risks on Venus. For example, future landers or orbiting craft may deploy aerostat balloons or aircraft to examine the Venusian atmosphere from elevations with more moderate temperatures. The article also highlights how cuttingedge materials, cooling techniques and autonomous systems could help probes withstand Venus' brutal environment much longer to achieve meaningful scientific objectives. While challenges certainly remain, these innovative approaches offer pathways to safely accessing more of the Venusian atmosphere and surface for research. 

In sum, while Venus poses very real threats, the author presents a persuasive argument that its study remains scientifically important and potentially feasible with further technological progress. Even in a hazardous environment, much could still be learned about geological and atmospheric evolution from our nearest planetary neighbor. For these reasons, the pursuit of Venus exploration as outlined deserves continued support and investment despite the dangers involved. The author makes a valid case that the scientific rewards could outweigh the risks for expanding our understanding of basic planetary processes.",1.0

e_p99m4bky,1,"Dear Senator,

I believe that the Electoral College is beneficial to our society and should be kept in order to make voting more fair than it was in the past. In my oppinion the Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting, represents the opinions of the public and gives an overall better outcome for the voting system.

First, the Electoral College has a higher percentage of trust between candidates and voters than any other method of voting. This is because the people of state are the ones who are supposed to control the presidental election. In the past the Electoral College voted like this, but now they are changing their minds. The way this election is run is entirely based on majority vote. Citizens can't decide what their vote for as their candidate is, it only matters that the state gets to choose the candidate that they want. It is a system in which they can go to the citizens and decide on the electors themselves. They can be trusted to be truthful and not bribe. Even though if that's not not true then it is better to leave it that way.

Though some may believe the Electoral College is a waste of time, it gives certainty of outcome that makes the voting system more reliable. This reasoning doesn't mean that each state is treated differently and that all types of voting are the same. In fact, if a Presidential candidate is running for office it's the candidates job to win over the votes of all the citizens in the state. This allows the senate and the house of representatives to decide the way in which the representative will be in charge of making their vote. The Senate would then go to congress and choose who they would want as the president and not the people. Now, in this day and age, everybody wants to be heard from all around the country and it is the right way to go.

Lastly, though people may not want to believe it, the Electoral College brings a certainty to the ballot that popular vote could not do alone. This certainty is ensured through a vote in congress and through the Electoral College, the state senate or state would decide who to vote for which president they wanted to win. When this happens if popular vote was chosen it would be more resonible to the decision of each state. In addition, it makes it more likely that an elector would have the same say in the election of the President. This would also be beneficial to candidates, because they can take the time to really think what they are trying to tell the people.

Although there are many negative results from electoral college, i believe the Electoral College is still more effective. There are resons why it should be kept and not aboloished. Popular vote, while having some flaws about it, may be the way to go. It's fair and represents the people honestly, but it provides the certainty that it must be changed for the good of the state. We need to have confidence in the candidates so we can have faith in them to carry out our responsibilities to make the right decision.",0.7

e_4grvariu,-2,"AlBaqarah A.M Fyzee's 1965 article ""The Muslim Law  of Divorce"" aims to provide a comprehensive yet balanced overview of the Islamic laws and principles concerning divorce. The primary focus of Fyzee's analysis is to educate readers about the correct laws and procedures of divorce according to early Islamic jurists, while also acknowledging some of the problematic practices that have arisen. 

Fyzee examines three main categories of divorce in his analysis: talaq, or repudiation of the wife by the husband khul , or redemption by the wife through payment of compensation and judicial divorce ordered by a qadi or Muslim judge. Fyzee relies on Islamic primary sources including the Qur'an and ahadith to lay out the foundations of each type of divorce and emphasizes that they should only be practiced ""under exceptional circumstances"" according to ""strict rules of procedure and propriety.""

Fyzee approaches the topic of Islamic divorce with an evident intention for objectivity and balance. While outlining the rights and laws of divorce that favor male prerogative, he also dedicates an entire section to ""Rights and Remedies of Women"" in case of abuse. He clarifies misinterpretations of certain Qur'anic verses and ahadith used to justify deviation from proper practice. Fyzee also juxtaposes past and present by lamenting the contemporary abuse of unilateral talaq, where the intended checks and balances have been stripped away, enabling capricious repudiation with ""gross disregard of the wife's right and interests.""

Fyzee does not shy away from addressing sensitive issues where the law of divorce has been misused, though he does so in a composed manner. He acknowledges practices used to deprive women of their financial rights, and the use of ""socalled 'talaqtulbida' or innovated repudiations"" not founded upon juristic precedent. However, Fyzee aims to educate rather than attack, drawing upon Islamic teachings about justice, propriety and corroboration as the basis for his criticism. He appeals for a ""return to the pristine purity of the Shari'a"", but an evolved understanding suited for modern circumstances. 

The primary audience for Fyzee's article is educated Muslims, both laymen and scholars, who wish to understand the proper Islamic laws of divorce and identify irreligious innovations that have become culturally accepted. His dry and legalistic tone, quoting of Qur'anic verses and ahadith in original Arabic, and detailed citation of past jurists' works indicate an audience wellversed in Islamic law. At the same time, Fyzee explains concepts and Arabic terms with the care and consistency of an introductory text, suggesting a secondary audience of nonMuslims with an interest in Islamic jurisprudence. Overall, Fyzee's appeals to ""the true Islamic spirit"" and closing recommendation of a codified system of personal laws appropriate for modern India demonstrate his hope to reach an audience in positions of legal authority and influence.

In conclusion, Fyzee's essay serves as an exemplar of scholarly analysis on a sensitive topic of Islamic jurisprudence. His expansive knowledge, balanced presentation, and courage to address misapplications of Islamic divorce law while appealing for judicious reform and revival of the religion's spiritual essence combine to make this work informative, thoughtprovoking, and relevant even today. Fyzee makes a valuable contribution to not only understanding the rightful purposes and practices of divorce in Islam, but also stimulating critical thought about the lived reality of Muslims in secular societies.",1.0

e_0nybg0hj,-1,"Some schools require students to complete projects over summer to assure they continue learning during the break. The school is thinking of adopting that rule and the principal is trying to decide if these summer projects should be designed by teachers or students. It would be best if the principal made these projects designed by teachers in order to make sure the projects are decently sized, factually correct, informative, and easy to understand and grade.

Some people say that if students were to make the projects, the projects would be kept at a good size because the students know better than everyone else what would be a fair, challenging project and the teachers would make the project overly long or short. However, since teachers are designing the project, they will focus on making the project not overly large because making a longer project means more grading for the teachers, while also not making a overly brief project because it will fail to keep the students learning and informed over summer break. If the students were to make the project they might feel compelled to make the project short and easy for the sake of less work.

Since the teachers are well informed on the subjects of the projects and know what the students need to learn or retain over summer break, they would be the best choice to make a project that is factually correct and informative. If students were to design these projects, they would be a greater chance of factual or grammatical error in the project, which is really damaging and will be hard for the teacher to reteach and correct.

The teacher is in charge of giving out grades to students and will format their assignments and projects so they are easy to grade. If the students were to create the summer projects, the teachers would have to figure out a rubric to grade the projects and judge how much the project should weigh on the students' grade, which can take quiet a bit compared to if the teachers just made the projects themselves.

The teachers are better at making sure the project for many reasons: they are better at formatting, they make less errors, and they'll make the project meatier than a student would. Think about this what if you were assigned a summer project for science that was intended to keep you well informed, but was overly brief, wasn't as well formatted as it could have been, had a confusing or nonexistent rubric, and had potential factual or grammatical errors. Would you want the students to make the project for the sole reason that they're students or would you take the paid, professional teacher? In short, the principal should make the summer projects designed by teachers.",0.0

However, praise can also have negative effects on selfesteem if it becomes the sole focus of a person's life. If a person becomes overly reliant on praise and recognition, they may become overly critical of themselves when they do not receive the praise they desire.

Firstly, students may not always provide fair evaluations. Students may have personal biases towards teachers based on factors such as appearance or popularity, rather than the teacher's actual teaching ability. This can lead to inaccurate evaluations and may harm a teacher's reputation, even if they are doing a good job. For example, a teacher who is strict but fair may receive negative evaluations from students who prefer a more lenient approach to teaching.

Secondly, student evaluations can place undue pressure on teachers to please their students instead of focusing on delivering quality education. A teacher who is more concerned with pleasing his or her students may not challenge them enough, leading to a decrease in the quality of education.

One example of the impact of first impressions is the way they can hurt people's feelings. For instance, I remember a time when I made a hurtful comment about my sister's wedding dress. I was trying to help her find the perfect dress for her big day, but my first impression was that the dress I saw was not the best choice.

Another example of the impact of first impressions is the way they can cause people to change. For instance, I once gave my best friend an opinion about her boyfriend that turned out to be wrong.

There are many advantages to limiting car usage. For one, it can save you money. If you live in a city or town with good public transportation, you can easily get around without a car. This can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year on gas, insurance, and parking.

Limiting car usage can also help to reduce your carbon footprint. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. If you can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, you can help to reduce your impact on the environment.

In addition, limiting car usage can improve your health. Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, and walking or biking instead of driving is a great way to get some exercise. It can also help you to reduce stress levels and improve your mental health.

Finally, limiting car usage can make your community more livable. When there are fewer cars on the road, it is easier to walk, bike, and take public transportation. This can lead to a more vibrant and connected community.

If you are looking for ways to save money, reduce your carbon footprint, improve your health, and make your community more livable, consider limiting your car usage. There are many ways to do this, and you may be surprised at how easy and enjoyable it can be.

Here are a few tips to help you limit your car usage:

 If you live in a city or town with good public transportation, take advantage of it. Walking, biking, or taking public transportation can be a lot cheaper and healthier than driving.
 If you live in a more rural area, see if there are any carpools or vanpools that you can join. This can help you to save money on gas and parking.
 When you do need to drive, try to carpool with friends or family members. This can help to reduce the number of cars on the road.
 If you are going to be doing a lot of errands, try to do them all in one trip. This can help to reduce the number of times you start and stop your car.
 When you are parked, try to park in a central location so that you can walk or bike to your destination.
 If you have to park in a parking lot, try to park in the back so that you don't have to walk as far.
 If you are going to be driving for a long distance, try to take breaks every few hours to stretch your legs and walk around. This can help to prevent fatigue and reduce the risk of accidents.

Limiting car usage can be a challenge, but it is worth it for the many benefits that it can provide. If you can make some changes to your lifestyle to reduce your car usage, you will be doing yourself, your community, and the environment a favor.",1.0
e_1ksv6tcy,2," The Face on Mars is not created by aliens. This is not only due to the fact that aliens do not exist. How do I know this? Well, for one i know that Mars is not suitable for any life forms due to the harsh temperature, lack of liquid water, no atmosphere, or the high amount of radiation. But the strongest argument against Face of Mars been created by an alien civilizaiton are recent photos from NASAs Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity which show that Mars, at one point, was a wet planet, but with the discovery of Gale crater and Curiosity Mars Science Labroatary finding that water was salty in Marians past. The fact that there is still salt water in liquid form today and water was salty on ancient Mars is in fact strong evidence that there is not life on mars now, never have been, and never will be in the form that most people envision, a race of humans. Mars could however be host to bacterial, archeal and even extremophiles life forms.
   But what exactly is the Face? Well, according to NASA and scientists it is a natural feature, more specifically a mountain with erosion that caused it. This is why in recent images the 'nose' is not present anymore in the recent photos, but in the past, it may be due to shadows caused by the sun position, which creates a 'false feature'. Also, the 'Face' is a part of many different features that include mesas. Mesas, according to MerriamWebster Dictionary are ""a relatively flat topped elevation standing above a level surrounding area"" with 'Face' having a 'face' on one side. But what exactly is a mesa. It is basically a butte with a much wider base due to slower erosion rate. A butte, again MerriamWebster Dictionary defines as, "" an isolated hill or hilllike elevation"", but unlike mesa, it does not have to have a flat surface at the top. There many different features in the world, but in Mars it is called Mesas which includes the Face, this is what the scientists believe, as they did multiple experiments to figure out. They even use the Mars orbiter camera to get the pictures of Mars with much higher quality, but not even this is the real feature, this is what the people are going to see, this is how people will know it.
   But what exactly is Mars exploration going to be doing for us in the future to help solve this riddle about the face of mars. One idea of Mars Exploration Rovers is the Mars sample return which they plan to get some samples to bring back. With samples, we may find that there is life after all, which we have no found it yet due to lack or resources to get proper analysis of the samples, which they believe they are capable to finding. The Mars sample return can give a great amount of new knowledge to help not only our understanding in space science, geology, chemistry, but our understanding in ourselves.
   Now what evidence is there for this idea about Mesas. One strong evidence is what the scientists of Mars Global Surveyor MGS discovered when they did some testing in Mars Global Surveyor MGS. When they did an imagery of Mars in April 5, 1989 it was taken ten times sharpier than original photos. When they analyzed this new imagery, they noticed there is no alien monument, which they concluded as natural features.",1.0
e_nkam6aqi,-8,"While reading paper while reading paper so that your car foams to your destination, who likes while sitting and sipping coffee?Sadly, it may sound, but that's not the case with a ""driverless car"".They are not really spectacular ideas, as they say that they are assumed that they are uninhabited and safe, but they must always be alert when they drive.Suspicious, they will probably be expensive.

These are said to be only processed by driving functions at a speed up to 25 mph, but they are equipped with sensors that confirm that drivers hold wheels.The car is designed to be able to maneuver, accelerate, and brake by yourself, but is designed to notify the driver when human skills are needed on the road ahead.After that, this ""driver less car"" driver must always be alert and are always ready to take wheels.As a result, the term driverless car is meaningless.

It is not just the worst in the world, not just to worry about people to be wary while riding an unmanned car.In many states, they believe that humans are the only safe driver, so they prohibit the use of computer driven cars.In many cases, this may not be true, but human drivers may always be a short circle, or not the computers that may not be.Humans seem to be more reliable, but if they see changes in their hearts and laws, as described in the text, ""If you fail and someone is injured, who is injured.Are you responsible  There is a driver. Or the manufacturer?

Except that these cars are not safe, most people think that these cars will probably sacrifice their arms and legs.I believe that these wise cars are smart and more high tech.What leads to the next question is what makes ""smarter cars"" smarter?According to the passage, Google changes the car, the position sensor of the WHIEEL in the left rear, the rotating sensor of the roof, the video camera attached near the back mirror, the four vehicle radar sensors, GPS receivers, the interchange sensor, interior layer motion sensor.Used, and does not include dubbed LIDAR, inside the car.All of this sounds like a very expensive material.As the time goes on, the more the sensor and things get better, the higher the pre form, but the value increases and the car becomes more expensive.

Ultimately, these more smart driver less cars seem to be so smart and not driverless because drivers need to be alert.Therefore, every time they do nothing, they need the driver's assistance and make driverless cars meaningless.Another person seems to look more religious behind the handle than the computer.Finally, they are more expensive than the annual tuition of Callju students.",0.9
e_njp91h6t,2,"Have you ever been curious about something that is not in our solar system? I have a couple of times and one of those things was the face on mars. The thing people think is just a conspiracy theory may be true, or maybe its an illusion. Many people believe that this face has alien origins. This could be possible but it's more likely to be some sort of natural land form. If there were actually aliens on mars NASA would want us to know so we can make contact with them, because that might help get funding for space travel. Also if they did find evidence of life on another planet we would tell everyone right away. People are wrong about thinking this landform was created by aliens when it was probably formed naturally. It's still somewhat mysterious how this formation got here though.

If the face was made my martians then why hasn't NASA found any other signs of intelligent life on mars. We have sent many rovers out there over the years trying to find anything else related to these ""martians"". Even if there was proof of life on mars NASA would tell everybody. They wouldn't hide it from anyone. For example, the quote says, ""There must have been a civilization on Mars."" Not ""there most definitely was a civilization on Mars,"" which means he doesnt know for sure yet. That statement also comes with no actual facts backing up his claim either. He is guessing at what happened there based off of the picture. Which isn't really fair to him or his audience.

People who say aliens built this structure don't provide any real factual information. In paragraph 7 it states that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West."" Which is saying that this is like normal earthly structures that happen all the time. So this is not super weird or rare occurance that only happens once every few millenia. This is something that happens normally. Even scientists dont fully understand why this occurs, as stated in paragraph 8 ""Scientists figured it was just another Mesalandform common around Cydonia"" meaning they do not completely understand this phenomenon. But they agree that it is normal. And since these scientists study this stuff everyday they should know best what it is.

This article gives good evidence as to why the face may be natural, although they both give great reasons as to why their opinion is correct. There are pros and cons to each side of this argument, however i am leaning towards the side that says this face was formed naturally. Since NASA would let us know if there was intelligent life on mars i lean more toward the natural side of this discussion. Although there are many unknown aspects of this story, the reason behind it will remain unknown forever. As the author said in paragraph 12 ""And so ten years ago Nasa unveiled the Faces on Mars... a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The text clearly points out that even scientists aren't sure exactly how or why this happened, so neither are we. The mystery of the face remains unsolved until further research is done on the matter.",0.9
e_iobki5md,1,"Dear State Senator, I am feeling the need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes for the president of the united states. I feel this way for three reasons. The first reason is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.

The first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the Electoral College still has it's defenders. That was the first reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The second reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes, is because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, butr for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So the Electoral College usually wins since the votes go in to the House of Representatives first, which is really unfair to the other people that are doing the election. That was the second reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The last reason why I think that they need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes, is because at the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair nto voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. But it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arrguments in favor of it are mostly asserstions without much basis in reality. That was the last reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

e_f12zyaun,4,"The Rise of Driverless Technology  

The development of driverless cars brings both promise and peril. While autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents and increase accessibility, their widespread adoption poses technological and ethical risks worth considering. On balance, a cautious approach to this new technology seems most prudent.

Details from the article support both sides of this debate. Driverless cars could eliminate human error, the cause of over 90% of crashes according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. By scanning the road and reacting quicker than humans, autonomous vehicles may decrease accidents and save thousands of lives each year. They could also help the elderly and disabled gain independent transportation. 

However, the article also raises legitimate concerns. Fully autonomous vehicles may not be achievable for decades, and transitioning too quickly could endanger lives. Machine learning is an imperfect process  without extensive realworld experience, algorithms cannot anticipate every situation like human drivers can. Ethical questions abound about how computers should respond in splitsecond situations involving loss of life. And widespread adoption could displace millions of jobs that rely on human vehicle operation.

Rather than rushing development, policymakers and companies would be wise to thoroughly test driverless technologies through pilot programs first. Humans must stay engaged as a failsafe to handle unexpected scenarios outside of algorithms' training. Any deployment should happen gradually, car by car, as knowledge improves. Overall safety and social consequences should take priority over profit or popularity considerations. 

Driverless cars offer promise, but also problems not yet solved. A prudent path forward is comprehensive research, rigorous testing, and cautious adoption  not abandonment of human oversight before the technology proves truly ready to drive itself. With care and oversight rather than carelessness or haste, autonomous vehicles may someday transform transportation for the better. But getting there will require balancing innovation and caution at every step.",1.0

e_tjm4gomp,-2,"In the small town of Harmonyville, there lived a young woman named Lily. She had always been captivated by the soothing melodies and lyrical storytelling of her favorite song, ""River of Dreams."" Every time she listened to it, she was transported to a realm of enchantment and discovered new layers of meaning hidden within its verses. Determined to unravel the song's mysteries, Lily embarked on a personal journey to deconstruct it and create her own short story.
The song began with haunting piano chords, narrating the story of a desperate longing for escape and a burning desire for change. Lily imagined a character named Ella, trapped in a monotonous routine of her daily life, yearning for something more. Ella, like many others in Harmonyville, worked tirelessly at the local factory, disconnected from her true passions and dreams. Intuitively, Lily felt that Ella's tale would serve as the foundation for her story.
One gloomy morning, as Ella walked to work, she unexpectedly stumbled upon a hidden path by the river. The path, lined with vibrant flowers and verdant trees, beckoned her towards a mysterious and enchanting world beyond her own. Despite being slightly apprehensive, Ella couldn't resist the alluring call of the river's serenade, which echoed the melody of her favorite song.
As Ella stepped onto the path, a warm breeze enveloped her, carrying whispers of forgotten dreams and lost hopes. Mesmerized by the allure of the envisioned paradise, she ventured further, each step propelling her closer to her heart's desires.
Along the river, she encountered a jovial group of musicians playing love ballads on harmonicas, guitars, and drums. Their melodies echoed the energy and sensuality of the song, stirring emotions within Ella that she thought had long been extinguished. Guided by their warming presence, she danced freely, twirling under the moonlit sky, allowing her soul to be reawakened.
Further down the river, Ella encountered a wise old sage named Seraphina, a guardian of forgotten dreams. Seraphina, a mystical being with timeless wisdom, recognized Ella's longing for change and offered guidance as they embarked on a soulsearching journey together.
Through magical forests, treacherous cliffs, and rickety bridges, Seraphina shared profound lessons of selfdiscovery, compassion, and resilience. Inspired by the song's lyrics, their conversations breathed life into Ella's aspirations, gradually transforming her perception of what was possible.
As they neared the end of their odyssey, Ella realized that her own dreams were not just personal but interconnected with the dreams of her community. Determined to bring change to Harmonyville, she returned, armed with newfound inspiration and the strength to challenge the status quo.
With the guidance of Seraphina's profound teachings and the melodies etched in her heart, Ella rallied her fellow townspeople to embrace their dormant dreams. Together, they transformed the factory into an artists' cooperative, a vibrant hub where creativity and passion flourished, and each person's unique melody was celebrated.
Through their relentless pursuit of living an authentic life, Harmonyville transformed into a true haven, awakening its inhabitants to a world where the river's song played in synchrony with their souls.
And so, Lily's short story unfolded, bringing the magic of her favorite song to life in a vivid tapestry of hope, discovery, and rejuvenation. In the end, she realized that deconstructing a beloved song had not only deepened her understanding of its meaning but also allowed her to create a narrative that held the power to ignite her own dreams and inspire others.",1.0
e_1rkwxtoy,-2,"Chief Financial Officer Resigns from DebtRidden Rogers Communications Inc.

Tony Staffieri, chief financial officer of Rogers Communications Inc., resigned suddenly from his role on Monday morning. Staffieri had served as CFO of Rogers for the past three years but has come under increasing scrutiny as the telecom giant has taken on significant levels of debt in recent quarters.  

In a brief statement, Rogers CEO Joe Natale thanked Staffieri for his contributions over the years but did not give a reason for the abrupt departure. Staffieri also did not issue a public statement about the resignation. The company said Paul Carpino, the current vice president of finance, will take over as interim chief financial officer while Rogers conducts a search for a permanent replacement.

Rogers took on 15 billion of longterm debt in 2019 to fund the purchase of wireless carrier Freedom Mobile from Shaw Communications. The additional debt burden caused concern among analysts and investors, especially as competition has intensified in the Canadian telecom market. Rogers also spent 26 billion to acquire media properties from Shaw, including cable channels, radio stations, and production facilities. The companys total debt now stands at over 29 billion, straining its balance sheet.

In Rogers most recent quarterly results, released last month, the company reported a 20% drop in net income along with a slight decline in revenue. The results were below analysts expectations, putting more pressure on the companys leadership. Staffieri came under fire for not providing reassuring guidance about Rogers debt levels and future earnings trajectories. His resignation is a sign of the heat that Natale and other senior executives are facing.

With new CEOs at its main competitors Bell and Telus, Rogers is looking to reassert itself in the competitive Canadian landscape. But reducing its substantial debt burden while investing in new infrastructure and technology will pose significant challenges for whoever takes over as the companys next CFO. For now, investors seem unmoved by the departureRogers stock was up slightly in early trading as the broader market also rose. But the company will need to provide clearer signals about its financial health to avoid further doubts about its direction. Overall, its a turbulent time for Canadas oldest and largest telecommunications company.",1.0
e_c4gszc5h,-3,"Dear Generic_Name 

 I think it is not correct because the praise of a student will not help to raise our knowledge or to build up the skills for the future for example if I'm not doing my homework, and I just do my classwork I am not going to be good at the test because I dont know how to do the homework. Is not always necessary to praise our work just to feel better because in my experience I don't get what it said. 

 The praising student make students feel less confident than the ones who get praised. But in the other hand there are some who praise their student work and say that i can do any work I want.My other example is when I take SAT exam I start to think how could I know what is going trough it, but in reality is I feel bad because it make me feel weak and insecure about the exam. Also because of my shyness and the people who help me solve my problems, the teachers can tell me anything that I need to change or fix or I can be better at my job at home and at school. The way that people think about praise is wrong because they think praise the work is the best way to motivate and motivate student to learn and not do anything else. Because of what they say we have to improve to get better, because when we see someone who do not believe in themselves and praise them they keep moving forward. That's why when someone does something that can make him feel good about it. And they know he can help others and that makes them feel so good or feel more confident to try again and to not give up with the same things they did. If we want to show others students that we are capable of doing that and make more easy our way of learning and making someone feel confident, then we should do something else to make them better and keep us motivated to work harder in our future. For example, I go to Math class everyday after school I practiced because my math teacher ask me for help. When my teacher say to me and my other friend to go and practice with her I tell her to practice everyday with my friends. She tell us that you should not be scared of the mistakes you made and you gotta be confident about your self because is gonna be easier and easier for you. Then the next time we practice more and then you would feel comfortable with what you did in that time. In addition, when you praise something you are doing right it makes you go backward so you wont be worry or be afraid of making mistakes in your future because you will see the improvement that make you better than others student who just keep on doing bad things, in order to grow up.",1.0

Just like the tittle say of this article. "" The challenge of exporling venus. It is not going to be easy trying to study life on venus and actually trying to live there. For example in the text it states that "" No spacecraft surived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this isue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Which means that no one has been on venus in a very long time. More evidence of how we can't live on venus is. ow there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venu's atmosphere. If you don't know what corrosive sulfuric acid is or what it does let me tell you, you do not want that. If that touches your skin it will literally melt your skin off and it will burn like nothing before.

Despite all of the negative things on venusthere are some benfeits that humans can get from being on venus. For example, in the text it says that. "" Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Also, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar eatures such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Another piece of evidence from the text says that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

Some more textual facts from the article says that

"" Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The text says "" Amagine a blip like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Just as or het airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Now that would be amazing for our scientist to do. Another thing that would be a benfit from being on venus would be solar power. We would pretty much never run out of sunlight and we could run off of solar pannels for a long time.

In Conclusion, all of the dangerous conditions on venus, there are some good things to come out of it.

You should never just be biased and look on one side, you should always look on the other side as well and see if there can be any benefit or any good that could come out of it. And becuase we are looking on the other side despite of the bad stuff maybe one day we could possibly live on venus.",0.0
e_ek8ft9sp,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is a system that gives more power to some voters than others, and it is a system that can lead to the election of a President who did not win the popular vote.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but she lost the election to Donald Trump because he won more electoral votes. This is not the first time that this has happened. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but he lost the election to George W. Bush because he won fewer electoral votes.

The Electoral College is a system that is unfair to voters. It is a system that makes it possible for a candidate to win the Presidency without the support of the majority of voters. This is not democracy.

I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. It is time for our country to move to a system that is fair to all voters.

Thank you for your time.",1.0

According to the passage Electoral college is a part of the US government and was founded by our founding fathers and is still the way we elect our president. So if there is nothing wrong with it then maybe it will help us. Some people might not agree with that and they might be the one who is working for this process. Others may argue that this method is not democratic at all but that all just means we dont have to put much of anything in the public eye.

Admittedly, I feel that we should keep the Electoral College because it tells us the facts and wether a person should or will be the next president. There are some problems with the process but we should always try to change it a bit. According to the passage ""Does the Electoral College work"" by Bradford Plumer, it shows that we have to do it for the right reason. The passage states that if you change the electoral college and vote for whoever you want, then you'll win and you have won. After this, you are going to be in favor of putting the election on the popular vote. If you dont like this method of choosing your next president then I think that is the best choice.

The voters in tossup states are more likely to pay closer attention to the campaign since they know they are going to decide the election. So in my opinion i like how they handle everything and if the need to change something they can always get the right to chose who will be the next president. This is a better way of doing things in the United States than the Electoral College.

e_gv1n5p6u,-7,People say that the face figure on mars is made by aliens. That hypothosis is not true because aliens do not excist. This figure on mars can be made by human. and it can be made by natural causes on the planet. as you can see in the pictures the face in 1976 it is full and the one in the second picture is half way gone the third picture it is almost completetly gone. if this figure is made by humans it will not come for long. If this figure is mad eby natural causes on the planet it has faded away over the years. Most people around the world think this figure is made by aliens This figure could have been made by the astronauts on the ships and they just made a figure and took a picture of it and made people think that it was made by aliens. This figure could have been made not even on the planet they could have took some clay or some other material and made a rock like face and said that they found it on the planet. This face is a a because is how often they scientists go to a planet and just find a a face that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up. If they do take an picture it will not have to look the the it the the it so the people of the going and say it was in space. If there really is a face figure on that planet that might be a sign of life on the planet. Maybe the astronauts have found another planet with life it may not be human it may be im not saying that aliens are real but if there is life on that planet this whole world will be wanting to go up there and see for themselves. If there is life on that planet then people will pay big money to go up also if theres life maybe we will go back up there and their might be another face figure. If you look at the first picturre and the second picture you can see that the eyes are in differnet spots so thses pictures might actually be fake.,0.05
e_plvs6lug,0,"When it comes to cars, we often hear that they are necessary for transportation. In reality, many people would agree that a car is not the only way to get around. In fact, there are many other methods of transportation that are better for the environment, including walking, biking, and public transportation. People who argue that cars are necessary for transportation often forget to mention the disadvantages of using a car for every day transportation. 

One of the biggest disadvantages of using a car for every day transportation is that it takes up a lot of space. A car can hold up to three people, but a bike can hold up to two people and a public transportation can hold up to five people. 

Another disadvantage of using a car for every day transportation is that it takes a lot of time to get around. A car can take up to an hour to get from one place to another, while public transportation can take around twenty minutes. 

In conclusion, it is evident that using a car for every day transportation is not the best option. There are other ways to get around that are more environmentally friendly and faster.",1.0
e_39ujzx47,1,"Dear Florida State Senator,

Dear state senator, I do not think that the Electoral College is a good way for voting. I belive that it should be abolished.

What is the Electoral College? ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place.""

Source 1, section 1.

This messes up the votes so the canidates get more votes than the other alot of the citizens want. Even though its not fair to them, the Electoral College has it's flaws that it causes not just votes to not matter. I belive it is because if you dont vote then it doesn't matter unless you persuaded the majority of people to vote. This means that the peoples votes dont matter. If we were to just let the citizens vote for who they want, we will be able to use that power for the new president, and give the Congress a good argument for putting the fate in the hand of the Electoral College.

Its not fair if every citizen thinks its fair. If a candidate, is running for president in your state, you think their vote is gonna decide who they want to become president. You have to have all the Electoral votes from each state.

Source 2, section 9.

In the Electoral College you vote not for the President, but for a state of candidates which in turn elect the president. This mainly causes states to get more votes because of the Electoral College, because they will have to spend more money in each state. In addition to the larger states, there will be no electoral votes for the person running in the state of Florida.

Source 3, section 23.

In the Electoral College the electors pick for who ever they believe should win. Then the citizens can go to states with more votes. This is a good way because the canidates don't spend their time on the big states because they are bigger, and they get to know that they should be the ones to decide the elections.

In all I think that the citizens of the United States should do the election. The Electoral College can't help people in big states. It's a waste of time, because it can be unfair. This is why we should change our election by popular vote.",0.7

e_7sulk033,0,"When using cars less cars aren't good because they can get into accidents and hurt themselves and others around them. There are also some bad things about cars and people would not care about how they used a car to get to places.

in addition, there are some people that would rather just drive around instead of wasting there time using a car. ""In German suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars""Duffer, ""Automobiles are the second largest source of America's emmisions"". But, there are more advantages to having limited car usage. People are using less cars, getting less polution, driving less, walking less. There are a few better things that can happen when people have to drive or use cars.

First, by limiting car usage the air would be clear from smog. ""New Yorks bikepooling program is a program where cars are allowed, but with limited usage the number of miles driven will decrease by 25 percent. This means that more people will be using their bicycles and walking and thats why we should get rid of cars every time we go somewhere new. Even though people have driven cars there are many things that you can do to stop it. For example, if you travel by walking theres only one place to park, which is in downtown New york, in German Suburb, Life goes on with out cars"". By using alternative forms of transportation, it's easy for people to get to places. By having less cars you are limiting your car use and you have less smog.

Last, in the end people are happier without a car and the more the stress gets down on them the happier people will be. ""The day without cars is the most common thing to happen in Vauban,Germany"". By using cars there is a lot of things that you can do without having to worry about to get somewhere fast. ""It is not easy to find places when you're not familiar with the area""President Obama, ""Slow down on spending time on the road to improve public safety and reduce greenhouse gases""Source 1. People are more happy and not stressed with cars and they won't have any problem at all when they have to go somewhere for something so important.

In conclusion, I believe that people should limit car usage because, it would reduce smog, improve people's safety, and people will become less worried about getting in a car crash or car accident. People will get less cars and have less stress because its less crowded or people are less stressed than they would be when they were using cars.",0.7
e_qpx0mq23,-1,"Have you ever asked for advice from a friend or family member? Seeking more than one opinion can help people make better choices. Talking to different people is helpful because they might have the same experience, it could be someone your close too and you trust them, also they may give you good advice on what to do. I think talking to other people about something important is always best to have more then one person there.

When asking for advice it's usually a big deal. When we ask for advice some times its hard to choose who to go talk to. The first thing that comes to mind is friends, but sometimes you don't want people knowing your problems so talking to an adult would be better in this situation. For example if you had a problem with a friend and didn't know what to say, i would go up to my mom and tell her what was going wrong between me and that friend of mine. She has been through many things like this before she would probably give me good advice to resolve our problem. Sometimes adults are harder to talk to when having issues, you never really know how they will react. It all depends on their personality and who they are as a person. Another reason why you should get more than one persons inputis if your not sure about what your doing. Lets say your at school and you need to finish a paper but you don't know where to start. You walk over to your teacher and explain what your trying to write about. She gives you advice on how to begin the assignment. After hearing her tips you feel confident enough to take on the task without any problems. Her ideas helped alot and gave you a good starting point which made everything way easier. These examples show that getting opinions from others is very beneficialand helpful.

When you get advice from people it helps your brain come up with solutions faster. Some people dont even need anyones advice for certain situations. If you know exactly what to do or what steps to follow, you wouldn't need anyone elses thoughts or opinions. This only happens in simple situations like making lunch or choosing clothes to wear to school. Those types of tasks are easy to accomplish alone and you won't need anyone else's opinions. However most of the time we seek help from others because of bigger problems. Lets say your parents are out of town and your 20 years old, living on your own, and don't know how to cook dinner tonight. You call your neighbor who knows how to cook and gets great reviews on his meals. He tells you what ingredients you need to buy and how to put together the dish he recommends you to eat. After he finishes explaining how to make the meal you head off to the store and grab everything he told you to buy. Once home you follow his instructions step by step and finish cooking the delicious meal hes recommended. That whole process started when you needed help figuring out what to cook for dinner. By listening to your neighbors advice you were able to create a wonderful dish for yourself to enjoy. Advice from others isnt just for helping you figure out life problems either, sometimes its helpful for everyday life and things like cleaning. Every day we struggle with little decisions such as what to do next, but those type of questions are not big deals nor do they require much effort. In conclusion seeking other peoples advice can benefit you in a multitude of ways whether its during a tough time or just to make your days run smoother.",0.9
e_4anq3k7c,0,"Ching Ching! This is the sound you might hear more and more as our world starts to rely less on outomobles. There are some advantages to this, there will be less air polution, less fossil fuels being burned, and less accidents. As with everything, there are always two sides of the arguement too.

First, there will be less polution because there will be less, or no automobles creating it. cars contribute 12 percent of the Earth's greenhouse gasses. Other countries have begun setting days that people can't drive becasue the polution gas gotten so substantial.

Another reason it would be helpful to use automobles less is because the majority of them burn fossil fuels to make them run, and this is devistating our worlds fuel supply. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable, and if we burn up all of it that we have, we will never have it agin.

Last, there will be less accident, which will result to less people getting injured or worse. There are so many automobile accident every year, if we cut them out of out society, the accident rate would be decreassed substansally.

In conclusion, there are many different reasons why getting rid of cars would be a positive movement for our society. It would reduce pollution, accidents, and the burrning of fossil fuels.",0.0

Driverless cars

My position is that driverless cars are a bad idea. They are a bad idea because they can be hacked by someone and they can put a virus on the car or something that can make it go crazy. They could also hack the car and make it crash or stop working at all. Another reason why they are a bad idea because the cars can't drive by themselves all the time they can't. They can't do this because the have to have a human to help them out. Even with the human help the cars still aren't fully driverless.

I think they are not good because most people would go crazy if the car they thought was a driverless car was not. The cars could also break down and that would cause a big problem. Some people could also get hurt from the break down or the car not being able to do what it is supposed to do. I think it would be a really bad idea to even make them at all. I think they would be a real big flop.

This is why i think they are a bad idea. I think it would be a big flop or a big mess if they were made.",1.0

When Luke went he would be helping horses, young cows, and mules being shipped over seas to a new locatation he had to help gather suplies, animals and many other things supplies to help out things that had gone wrong also 44 nations joined together to help them out.

In one of Luke's trips there had been more then 335 plus enough hay to feed all of them. By time Luke had turned 18 he had arrived in Greece which meant he could go into the military service. When Luke had been discharged he had maken more then nine trips, that is the most any Seagoing Cowboy has ever gone in this service. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the United States, and on top of it took them a month to get to China.

When Luke was younger he used to help out on his Aunt Katie's farm, this helped him to learn his hardworking skills but never trained him for the dangers at sea. He had decided that helping out in the Seagoing Cowboys and all of the animals, and food services was worth all the help that him and his pals had given. It was real rainy one night after making his hourly check up on the horses to report to the captain when he had slipped down a slippery ladder ship cracking some of his ribs so then he couldn't do his job for a couple of days.

Luke also had a lot of fun on board with all of his friends. When the animals had been unloaded they played baseball, volleyball, fencing, table tennis and a lot more sports and game. Luke said that being a Seagoing Cowboy was way much more then an adventure he had opened up the world for Luke. He was very grateful for his jouney, it mad him more aware of the other countries and there needs.

e_mamc2xgj,6,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" i will like to tell you what the dangers of studying venus are and what we can do to help in the future to know how to live on that planet. Can we really live on venus the normal way or a new way? When testing if we can live on Venus there are some flaws but some of them can be fixed like how in paragraph 3 it says "" Humans have sent numerous of spacecraft to land on this cloud daped world. This is all the way the author is describing the planet with the facts of it so we will know what to do if we do it or we dont survive on venus. Also we also test out computer made electronics made of silicon carbide or other mterials. That is just my opinion on this subject a lot of this information is right so that means that maybe we can start using something or test it on the ground and see how it works. Those facts help us see that we can have a new era in technology and what if one day it could be our oppition to live on that planet. That is why I think the author of the story is making evidne to show us how to live and what we should do when we die. So that is all i have to say. While we are testing this idea of going to Venus there are some very good and evideneous ways we can go and test it in our lab. But in my opinion it is very well worth it to be testing it on a new planet that is close to us.",0.7

e_nwf5oy5j,5,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System would be a good thing for schools because it can tell how your feeling. I think this is really cool and useful to use in classrooms, or anywhere else. The article says that ""you could recognize when some one is happy or sad"". This is very important if you are teaching someone something like math, reading, or even helping them do their homework. If they look bored then maybe change what your doing with them or ask them if they need help. Then make sure they understand and know what there doing so they don't get confused.

The article also tells us that we can do the same as well. We all have 6 different emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness. When were around our friends we always try to put on a fake smile, but people who see through that will not believe anything that you say. You can just go off by the facial expressions you see on peoples faces everyday. For example if someone makes a funny joke, you might laugh at first then realize its not funny after all. Thats why you should use the FACS in order to find out whether your friend likes your jokes or not. Its better than having no clue about other peoples feelings.

Another reason why i think this should be used in classrooms is so teachers can tell who needs extra time or help. They can see who is getting bored of learning a certain subject and switch things up before the students get too restless. Also they can help kids that may be struggling with math or any other subjects. The only down side to this is that sometimes people dont want others knowing how they feel. Sometimes it depends on the person. Not everyone wants the world to know their thoughts or feelings, but im pretty sure most people wont mind either way. So why not give it a shot? What do you guys think? Wouldn't you love to know exactly whats going on in someone elses head instead of guessing everytime? It would be great for anyone to use especially teachers.",0.9
e_a9yfu259,-7,Today s society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That s why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed. As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution. For example In Bogota Columbia their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Other places like Paris banned driving to clear the air of the global city. This is due to days of nearrecord pollution. The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution. Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two says When I had a car I was always tense I m much happier this way. Also businessman Carlos A. Plaza said It s a good opportunity to take away stress. as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. When you don t drive you don t have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams you won t be mad because someone just cut you off or that the teenage girl in front of you isn t paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street you will realize how stressful driving can be. In conclusion driving only causes air pollution and more stressfull days.

e_pf6jrtgw,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and welldocumented. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote physical activity. In addition, limiting car usage can save money and improve quality of life.

One of the most important advantages of limiting car usage is that it can help to improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to cleaner air for everyone. In fact, a study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that reducing vehicle emissions by just 1% can save up to 4,000 lives each year.

Limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can lead to a number of problems, including increased pollution, lost time, and stress. Reducing the number of cars on the road can help to alleviate traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get around.

In addition to improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion, limiting car usage can also promote physical activity. When people walk or bike instead of driving, they get more exercise, which can help to reduce their risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. In fact, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that people who walk or bike for transportation are more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines than people who drive.

Finally, limiting car usage can also save money. Car ownership and operating costs can be a major expense, and reducing the number of cars in a household can save a significant amount of money. In addition, people who walk or bike instead of driving can save money on gas, parking, and insurance.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and save money. If you are looking for ways to improve your health, save money, and reduce your impact on the environment, consider limiting your car usage.",1.0
e_ekrcbkgk,5,"The author presents some interesting things about this new technology. Throughout this article, I have learned somethings about the Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to tell if you are sad, happy, etc. This system is really valuable in my opinion because it could help teachers figure out how a student is feeling, which could be useful in some situations in the long run. The system should be implemented in schools so they could have a better experience on what they are teaching because the way they teach things can be very valuable. Even though you may not want to tell how your friend is feeling, the system can detect your feelings to help the teacher know exactly what is wrong with a student. The computer facial coding system is valuable in my opinion for various reasons as you may see in this essay.

The facial coding system can have a good impact on peoples' thoughts, emotions, and attitudes in many different ways. This system can be useful to someone who has trouble in the classroom or any other situation. This technology can also help teachers understand their students better. The computer can tell when they need to speak up, if the teacher is getting confused, who is at fault? And the teachers can take the system to use this so it can help them understand whats the problem really is, and make the lesson less boring. If they can figure it out then they should go back a bit more deeper on the subject to help that person out.

In the conclusion to figuring out if this new technology system is valuable, it most certainly is. It can be useful in many ways. The system is able to tell if an individual is lying or not. This system could also be useful to help someone to understand how someone is feeling in a certain kind of way. This system is useful in medical fields because it can find out if there is something wrong with the person and the way they act, to help them to know that their treatment is good. This could also be helpful for the therapist and doctors in the hospital so that the patient doesn't have any issues with them.

It would be amazing if it could help someone who is lying to you and not telling the truth or not being truthful. Knowing how people are feeling can be a great help to figuring out how they are going to feel. This kind of technology is very useful for doctors and even doctors to see when there is something wrong or wrong. Using this new technology could also help out in hospitals and hospitals to know what is going on in the family's life.",0.7

The Basic Law Hong Kong s posthandover constitution clearly states that it is up to the future government to draw up its own law on these matters Tung told about 100 members of the 400strong Selection Committee that will choose Hong Kong s future leader. The Special Administrative Region government will have to review these issues after the handover. Britain hands its colony back to Beijing at midnight next June 30. The The Selection System is is the part of a threeday vetting of Wang and two rivals who are bidding for the colonial leader of Kong. The winner will be announced on December 11. On Tuesday Britain began the process of bringing in a law on subversion laying down legal markers defining the concepts of treason sedition subversion and secession in a bid to head off Chinesestyle jailings of dissidents after the handover. China has condemned the move but stopped short of saying whether the law would be scrapped when it takes over the territory. Tung a billionaire shipping tycoon also told the committee that Hong Kong should stand by China if Beijing is under sanction by foreign powers. If sanction is for political reasons then we have to consider Hong Kong s position. Maybe Hong Kong has to take some of to China. An opinion poll released on Thursday showed Tung to be the favourite among the 967 respondents and indicated 73 percent of them also believed Tung was the candidate best able to communicate with the Chinese government. The poll conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that only 7. 2 percent thought former chief justice Ti Liang Yang could commmunicate well with Beijing while businessman Peter Woo scored only two percent. But Yang was seen as being the most impartial of the three and the one most ready to voice his opinion to China. Asked who was most likely to speak out against Beijing 31 percent said Yang 20 percent Tung and 4. 8 percent Woo. After the first day of questioning by the committee on Wednesday Tung emerged as a better communicator than he had during previous occasions analysts said. They said he produced a clearly focused vision for Hong Kong with the main thrust on putting business and economic interests first.

At present they are objecting to anything Chinese Tung said. This is not good in the long term or for the interests of Hong Kong.

e_839x8vyo,-7,"The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver reveals a heartfelt approach to statistical interpretations and predictions of data. The text explains why so many predictions fail and how researchers fall victim to masses of data while finding important signals is mostly a matter of caution diligence and correctly assessing ones abilities. The author argues that most predictions are wrong because the investigators poorly analyze their their data. A certain statistical problem is presented and evaluated then a tentative solution is offered. The author also suggests that statisticians can often benefit from applying multiple perspectives toward a problem. However while it might be possible to obtain multiple data sets for something like weather forecasts such an approach becomes more challenging with a field like economics or politics. Silver 145 argues that many statistical errors occur when researchers attempt to predict too accurately and are overly confident in their abilities. He implies that while economic and weather forecasts are equally coarse economic ones attempt to predict polls and rates in exact numbers rather than settling for an expected range of outcomes Silver 146. Thus combining multiple attempts with various predictions will yield a more accurate result. Furthermore the current overabundance of nearly any data type results in muddling the real signals. Given the human tendency to seek patterns people perceive them where they do not exist and build predictions based on false alarms. Silver 155 reminds the readers that correlation does not imply causation. For instance with the sheer multitude of economic indicators some coincidental correlations are bound to arise Silver 153. Therefore each potential causation should be not only subjected to the standard test of statistical significance but the simple test of common sense. After systematically refuting the wrongs in the world of statistical predictions Silver usually offers some solutions for the given problem. His allencompassing suggestion to make the predictions better is to use Bayes theorem of conditional probability or Bayesian reasoning. The theorem allows predicting the likelihood of a theory or hypothesis under the assumption that some even has happened before that Silver 198. Silver 198 uses the opportunity to remind readers that the idea behind Bayes theorem is not that one updates the probability estimates just once. Rather, one is the to to a and review of assumptions as well as new information are found. In this part of the book the author highlights the vitality of staying open to new information and thinking probabilistically about the world. Subsequently the the author argues that specific models simplify the universe and they can be be given the details. In that Silver 188 is a firmer believer that all models are wrong but some models are useful. Therefore it is wrong to believe that applying an ideal and universal model to a given problem is possible given the often intermixed and incomplete nature of the real world. However Silver 327 argues that imperfect predictability is not a excuse to abandon research. he provides the the example of climate change and the lack of climate models. However this uncertainty justifies the need to focus on climate change mitigation because the potential risk of the problem being worse than anticipated entails much more negative consequences than in the median case. In conclusion The Signal and the Noise encourages its readers to honor the Bayesian probabilistic way of thinking regardless of whether it may seem uncomfortable at first. The narrative calls to know where the prior beliefs and future assumptions are coming from to make truly careful and exact predictions. Furthermore Silver 368 encourages statisticians to try and err making many attempts and tests of the ideas that come to mind. The author ponders human perceptions of predictability warning the researchers against the common bias of thinking that they are better at prediction than in reality. Overall this book presents a powerful argument supporting scientific mindset and critical thinking using reliable data analysis.",0.05
e_u456egsw,0,"limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for the individual and the community. First and foremost, limiting car usage can help to conserve resources. Car usage can consume up to 40% of the total daily energy use in the United States, making it important to conserve this type of energy. In addition, car usage causes air pollution, which can cause negative effects on the environment. Finally, car usage can increase the number of accidents. In the United States, each year, an average of 56 people are killed in car accidents. This number increases when looking at traffic fatalities, which can amount to 400 people per day. Each of these deaths costs the economy 37 million.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can reduce traffic congestion. In the United States, average speeds on major highways are around 60 mph. When traffic congestion exists, it can slow down the entire grid and cause long delays. By limiting car usage, we can help to reduce the congestion on the highways. This will have a positive impact on the economy, as the increased traffic will be less expensive.

Finally, limiting car usage can help to improve the environment. In addition to air pollution, car usage can cause water pollution. When water is polluted, it can contain harmful chemicals that can have negative effects on the environment. In addition, car usage can increase the number of accidents. When accidents happen, it can cost a lot of money to fixed the damages. By limiting car usage, we can help to improve the environment and reduce the costs of accidents.",1.0
e_r013023e,5,"The Facial Action Coding System FACSis a recent innovation in facial recognition software. It can deciper what a perosn may be feeling by analysing muscle movements and facial structure. While the technological impact of FACS is revolutionary, can a sytem like it be used in schools to give insight into the emotions of a student? The value of FACS in schools has the ptoential to become great, but as of now, FACS still has many challenges to face in order for it to become a practical and valuable part of the education sytem.

Currently, FACS can only recognize ""...six basic emotionshappiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."". While this abilty is a great acheviment, FACS would have to be able to read many more expressions, such as confusion, boredom, or understanding to become useful in a classroom enviornment.

If implemented in its current state, FACS might look at each student's face and would be able to pinpoint only the happy or suprised students, but typically, the happy students are not be the ones who need help. Without the capabilities to recognize more emotions, FACS would serve little purpose in this setting.

The artical also states that "" Your at home PC can't handle the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Many school comtuters are out of date and wouldn't be able to run FACS either. So, in order to correctly use it, a school would have to spend large amounts of money to purchase machines with the computing power to run FACS, an investment that may not pay off for years. This expense would only be made greater by the cost of the software itself.

So, while the Facial Action Coding Sytem has the ability to become an integral part of the education sytem, with its current capabilities, it would seem that FACS is not yet ready to assume the role of a valuable tool in classrooms arcross the country.",0.0
e_21qebkv2,3,"You should join the Seagoing cowboys program. You get to go sight seeing, you help people in need of animals and food sources, and last but not least it is an experience that will stay with you for your whole life. It is also a good job if you love animals. Also, they pay well! This is why I think that you should become part of this group called The Seagoing Cowboys. If you like adventure, then this is what you are looking for. Just imagine, going around the world on a boat with all kinds of animals. How amazing does that sound? Now let me tell you about my experiences when I was on the ship.

When I first got onto the ship, there were no animals or supplies on board. We had to wait until we reached Greece. That took 2 weeks to arrive at because it was so far from where we lived. When we arrived, it was dark outside. The next day the weather was perfect. Then came the news that World War II was over. So, now Europe needed our help to recover their countries' food supplies, animals, and more. After we received orders to report to New Orleans, Louisiana, we started getting horses, young cows, and mules ready for their trip across the Atlantic Ocean.

We had to take care of these animals by giving them hay and oats three times a day. They would have to be watered two or three times a day too. Stalls had to be cleaned every night. These jobs kept us busy during the crossings. The captain always allowed us to play games in the empty holds where the animals used to stay. Tabletennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games helped pass time. Being able to see Acropolis in Greeece was special. Taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, was another perk of being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

But, there were dangers involved as well. One stormy night I slid down a slippery ladder and almost fell offboard into the dark Atlantic Ocean. Lucky for me, a small strip of metal along the edge stopped my fall. But, I couldn't work for some days because of broken ribs. There could be many things happen on board, but don't worry because you can learn how to prevent bad things happening while working there.

I hope I convinced you to come here to the Seagoing Cowboys program. Please come here if you want a great time and a wonderful job. You won't regret coming here and staying here forever. I promise you that. Thank you for your consideration.",0.9

In this article, ""The Challene of Exploring Venus"", the author is explaining the difficulties of researching Venus closer, and why it is near impossible due to the challenges the planet provides. The author states what challenges the planet poses, and how scientists are trying to overcome those challenges. The author also says why the planet is worth the risk of exploration. The author supports the claim that Venus is a worthy persuit for exploration, disregarding the dangers, because Venus has many similar geological structures and could have once supported life due to the planet's simularities to Earth, but the author doesn't provide much more evidence as to why it is a worthy persuit.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers that it presents. The author provides several pieces of evidence to support this idea, including the potential for discovering new information about the planet's atmosphere and the possibility of finding signs of life. However, I do not think the author does a good job of convincing readers that studying Venus is worth the risk.

Overall, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does not adequately support their idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They provide the reader with amazing pieces of information about Venus and how dangerous it is, but fail to give enough reasoning as to why the journey would be worth these drastic risks. After reading the article, it is most likely that readers feel well informed about Venus and its mysteries, but unconvinced that the pursuit is worth the dangers.",0.5
e_nqttowat,0,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the rising cost of gas, and the increasing congestion on our roads.

There are many advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can help to improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to the development of smog and acid rain. Limiting car usage can help to reduce these pollutants and improve the air we breathe.

Fourth, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can add stress to your daily commute. By limiting your car usage, you can help to reduce traffic congestion and make your commute more enjoyable.

Fourth, limiting car usage can improve public health. Walking and cycling are good forms of exercise, and they can help to reduce obesity and other health problems. Limiting car usage can encourage people to walk and cycle more, which can improve their health.

Finally, limiting car usage can help to save money. Cars are expensive to buy, maintain, and insure. When we limit our use of them, we can save a lot of money.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. It can help reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and noise pollution. Therefore, it is important for us to consider ways to limit our car usage, whether it's by carpooling to work or by taking public transportation.

Finally, limiting car usage can help reduce our dependence on oil. Cars are a major source of oil consumption, and by reducing our reliance on them, we can reduce our dependence on oil. This is important, because oil is a finite resource, and we need to find ways to reduce our dependence on it.

In addition to the advantages listed above, limiting car usage can also help to promote social interaction. When people walk or bike instead of drive, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and the people in their community. This can lead to a stronger sense of community and a more vibrant public life.

Overall, there are many good reasons to limit car usage. It is good for the environment, our health, our communities, and our economy. If we all make an effort to limit our car usage, we can make a big difference for the world.",1.0
e_2oqbzfkf,5,"I would use this technology in a classroom. I think it is very important and helpful to teachers and students. This technology can help the teacher know what mood they are in or if they need any help with something, like a problem on a test for example. The student could be confused but not want anyone to see them feel that way so instead of asking someone for help they just struggle through it. If they knew there was an option where you dont even have to ask for help they might take advantage of it. Also when people do work online they sometimes cant focus because their mind is wandering around somewhere else or maybe they are tired from staying up late at night. Now all you have to do is put your face into the computer and let the software read how you are feeling. It will then change the lesson accordingly.

e_ngixazp1,-2,"It is no surprise to anyone that professional sport is inseparable from monumental physical and mental challenges. Highprofile athletes across disciplines have spoken up on how excruciating training, ongoing lifestyle restrictions, social isolation, and an inevitable race against time have affected their mental wellbeing during and after their sports careers. Most of these struggles are, to a degree, unavoidable, but an impossible standard of neverending endurance that athletes have to face outside of practice and championships has undoubtedly made them even harder. The New York Times article Simone Biles Rejects a Long Tradition of Stoicism in Sports 2021 comments on the standard and the way American gymnast Simone Biles rejected it during the Summer Olympic Games 2020. It explores the tense and complex question of emotional vulnerability in big sports and the cost of such vulnerability.
Right at the beginning, the article acknowledges the cultural shift toward acceptance of mental struggles both in general and particularly in athletes. An athlete of Simone Biles stature ten years ago, or even five years ago, might have been hesitant to admit that she battled with pressure, much less withdraw in the middle of an Olympic competition. Simones decision to quit the largest international event in the sports world has made her a poster figure of the relevant yet uncomfortable conversation. Success in sports, as well as in many other fields, is impossible without selfdiscipline and willingness to struggle. Yet, which point is considered a respectable place to pause and allow oneself to recover? After her pivotal decision, Simone has experienced online backlash with accusations of lack of patriotism and strength of spirit. It is therefore clear that for many people the overall result remains significantly more important than the mental wellbeing of an athlete. Such a setup, however, is an almost certain recipe for an eventual tragedy, a burnout, or even worse, that could have been avoided if ones mental needs had been taken seriously early enough.
The article proceeds to recite the comments of Sian Beilock, the president of Barnard College, who studies the dynamic between outside pressures and the minds of athletes and business people. According to Beilock, the growing willingness of athletes to speak up proves that mental health issues touch everyone. Biles, Osaka, and others open admissions are, according to Beilock, essential in the ongoing endeavor to destigmatize the questions of mental health issues Longam, 2021. If a renowned and successful athlete can experience anxiety, depression, and struggle with pressure in general, then regular people should not put unrealistic expectations on themselves.
It can be devastating for an athlete to perform poorly at the most anticipated and public moment of their career. As such, admitting the pressure and taking a step back might be a smart decision not only within the moment but for the longterm trajectory of an athletes ongoing path in their chosen sport. Sustainable lasting success and consistent performance are only possible when a person recognizes and accepts their limits. There is no shame in needing the help of others, as well as there is bravery in admitting the fact and adjusting current actions. At the end of the day, unnecessary endurance does not necessarily reflect greater resolve within championships. As everyone has their resources, it is essential to utilize them in optimal ways without ignoring the basic needs of the human psyche.",0.0

e_tu7iw455,6,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The following topics the author used helped support this idea: the challenges, dangers, and the fasinations with Venus needs to be explored.

Our neighboring ""twin,"" that we can only observe by hovering far above it hopping to get as much detail as possible, creats a challenge due to how unsafe it is. Our scientists have ""sent numerous spacecrafts"" to Venus. But, each previous mission was unmanned because, no spacecraft survived the landing for mpore than a few hours. Also, due to the high pressures and heat on this planet there is ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on the surface.""

Due to the challenges, it makes it so much more dangerous. Since,

Venus is second to our sun and has an ""atmosphere of 97 precent carbon dioxide blanket"" and a tempeture average over 800 degrees Fahrinheit."" It makes it really hard for NASA to get a close look do to Venus's unsafe tempertures. Also, Venus has an ""atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what us humans experiance on our own plant."" Which is way ""more extreme than anything we have had to encounter."" Plus, if NASA were able to find away to float thirtyplus miles above the suface it ""would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit."" But, on the bright side ""it would have the air pressure close to at sea level on earth.""

But, despite these challenges and dangers there is plenty of fasinations with this planet. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" Also, Venus still has some features similar to earth such as: valleys, mountains, and craters. Making more scientist to want to explore it to see if it was once habital by other creatures. Further more, making then to suspect that ""Venus was probably once covered largely with oceans.""

Based on the author hitting the points that exploring Venus can be challenging, dangerous, but yet fasinating helps get across the fact the he feels like despite the dangers Venus presents it is still a worthy prusuit to study.",0.0

e_br6kwhsq,0,"CarFree Cities"" gave the reader a broad perspective on the advantages of limiting car usage. The world would become a more ecofriendly and overall good place if we were to make this change happen all over the world. The passages give great reasoning to why this change should happen.

Limiting our usage on cars would help the environment completely. The amount of pollution would have a massive decrease. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced partial driving ban to clear the air."" This statement comes from the passage, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" and gives an example on how having driving restrictions would make the world more healthy for the economy. Using other ways for transportation could help prevent the enormous amount of pollutants in the air, like bicycles or carpooling. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" This example shows ways we can have transportation instead everyone individually uses cars and causing more pollution.

Instead of driving, riding a bike or walking to the places you need to go could be a huge stress reliever. People need to go outside and get fresh air, this can happen if we decrease the use of our cars or vehicles. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This statement was said in the passage, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogot"" and gives a perfect example on how using different types of transportation can relieve one's stress and lower the pollution on the world and the economy.

When no longer using so many cars, and vehicles the traffic would decrease majorly. Not as many people would be driving if carpooling or using other ways of transportation like bikes. This will also make the number of wrecks or accidents go down since not as many people would be in the situation for this to happen. Having less accidents would also save lots of lives, so many people die or get severely injured from car accidents and this can be a way to keep so many deaths or injuries from happening.

The idea of having a carfree environment is a great plan for the future and would be a positive change for the world and the environment we live in.",0.0

e_ukpe76yp,2,"From what I've read, I believe that the Face is a natural landform. There are three reasons that I think this, and I'll explain them all in this essay.

My first reason for believing the Face is a natural landform is that if NASA knew anything about aliens or artifacts, then they would probably tell us. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" It's their job, and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens.

My next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the Face looked like an alien artifact, the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality.. According to the author in paragraph 11, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptianstyle pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were,"" which proves that the Face isn't an alien structure or artifact.

My last reason is that the Face is a mesa, just like the kind we have on Earth. In paragraph 12, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West,"" showing how the Face is just a normal landform with strange shadows.

e_6ktmyisg,0,"The multiple sources talk about the benefits of limiting car usage but also the reaction of people and whether they think positively of it if they're for or against what the experts propose for a solution of car pollution problems. We can see that the different cities have cared when those environmental issues increased and so they reacted by different methods.

We're living because of nature without nature we can not live. People finally realized because of the warnings from nature for example Smog in big cities, gray clouds that dumped occasional rain acid on Bogota. They finally saw the problems that they caused. So that they found some solutions to have less smog so they banned driving cars, not all of them will stop driving but they didn't talk about money so they imposed some fine 31 if they didn't leave their cars at home. As they were not willing to pay the fine, people obeyed it because we all know that Paris is an extremly busy city that can't think of using cars less even if they have to pay. But people have to see how the environment is getting bad because of cars.

e_ac68nwie,2,"Introduction:
Have you ever dreamt of a human face on the moon? If yes, then what would have been your thoughts if the picture taken by NASA space crafts showed exactly the same human face like thing on Mars surface which we commonly find on the sand or hillocks. This article will explore how the picture taken by NASA space craft unmasked the face on Mars to show what is it really. In other word we are going to explore this natural formation and disprove the myth behind this formation being constructed by Aliens, if it is so. Let us start with some information regarding the picture taken. This Picture is the picture taken by NASA space craft called Mars global Surveyor and taken during September 1976. The picture is taken near the Equator on Mars which is located in the Cydonia region. It became a popular picture because the picture showed something like face. This is a very controversial picture and there are different views to the picture taken by this space craft. In the following sections of this paper we will learn more about this face on Mars, and also how this space craft picture disprove this Alien myth behind it.
Body:
Claim 1 the picture taken is a human face like formation and Aliens built it. 
Response the picture taken by this space craft is taken in very low quality resolution. So if we examine the pictures carefully, the picture taken by this space craft clearly shows the head only without any body part or structure. In reality human face have bodies. This disprove the alien myth. If it is the picture taken by Aliens we would clearly have bodies along with heads.  This face is just the picture taken by this space craft of the sand and hillocks like things we commonly see and form on hillocks. This sand or small rocks pile is just naturally formed by sand and hillocks. This disprove Aliens myth behind face. This sand or little stone pile have some shading like formation which makes human face like formation. If we examine these formation closely and compare the picture taken by this space craft with sand and hillocks. This sand and hillocks like formation have no body part. 
Claim 2 Picture is the picture taken by Aliens 
Response  this picture taken by NASA is not clear due to the low resolution camera this space craft uses. We cannot determine whether this space craft is the picture taken by Alien because NASA does not confirm this theory. This disprove Alien behind the formation and NASA is still working on taking the clear pictures to determine and confirm this theory behind this picture taken. 
Claim 3 Mars face is just the normal formation not a structure 
Response  this is clear now. This sand hillocks formation and little sand hillocks formation and little sand stone pile is just the picture taken. This disprove Alien behind this formation and confirm this is not a structure or an ancient civilisation but it is the picture taken. This disprove Alien behind formation. This sand and hillocks formation like human face like formation is due to some shade and sand hillocks formation and little sand stone formation piling together. These pile of sand, little sand hillocks form a structure due to sand hillocks form on the sand and little sand stone formation piles up. This pile of sand little sand hillocks form a structure due to shade and little sand stone formation piling together. This pile of sand forms some sort of picture taken. This disprove Aliens myth behind it. 
Conclusion:
We learned the truth about the controversial picture taken in the article. This face on Mars, which many people think is taken by Alien. Is clearly not taken by Alien.",1.0

e_womrtacb,4,"I support driverless cars for many reasons. The main reason is safety. Another reason I support these cars is because they will be smarter and better drivers than an average person. In the end, this could also end up saving many people a lot of money on gas. Driverless cars could be a bright future.

In order to get these cars to be legal and available for purchase and driving, the safety of people must be a sure thing. This means car manufactures will have to work hard to ensure that safety will not be a concern for the driver, other drivers, or anyone else. Technology has advanced to the point where computers know more that most of the general population, so taking the wheel out of the hands of the driver for about ninety percent of the time is actually a lot safer than leaving it in their hands.

People tend to make many mistakes while driving, and that can cause problems. But letting a car drive itself could end up being the best idea ever. A car that knows where it's going will be less likely to make a mistake than a human driver. This could help to aviod accidents, accidently or purposely breaking the law, and other dangerous situations.

These cars also are suppose to save people money on gas, because it wouldn't use as much gas as cars do now. If it uses have the gas as cars do now, people won't to buy gas as often. That can save people money. Money is always a factor in every situation. The more you save, the better.

In conclusion, I support driverless cars. They can end up being safer than humans driving cars, they can be smarter, and they can use less gas. Driverless cars seem to have more ups than downs. I hope to see driverless cars become a big thing in the near future.",0.0
e_y3b5ghba,-7,In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D Alto technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology should be used in schools to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because being able to identify what might be bothering others could be beneficial. Young adults could be facing something serious in their life but may not have the right words to express how they feel. Finding help for those feeling down is difficult. Using this technology could help those in need. This technology can help with identifying if a student is happy or worried being able to have fun and put a smile on a students face while using this technology and being able to identify if a student is confused or bored. The Facial Action Coding System can help with students and their emotions. Of course most students would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc. 5. Not everyone can tell what an individual is feeling. The help of this technology can help those who need it most. It can help detect if a student is happy or worried but it can also put a smile on someones face. Using this technology can help put a smile on your face in many ways. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face. 6. A lot of technology used today can put a smile on someone s face. Video games social media etc. Using the Facial Action Coding System is beneficial in many ways as well. It can help with being productive getting help for a student who might need it. Technology can help with putting a smile on a students face but it can also help with identifying if a student is confused or bored. Technology can help identify if a student is confused or bored and could also help them for later in the future. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. 6. Being able to identify a students emotions in a school could possibly help the student with getting better grades feeling better about themselves and passing each day with positivity. It can be difficult for a student to explain how they feel to another. The Facial Action Coding System has multiple ways on finding a solution for many problems that students are faced with today. This technology can help detect if a student is confused or bored if a student is happy or worried and being able to have fun with this technology. Today many students are faced with difficult times. Students have to deal with so much during their schooling years and having difficult emotions to deal with also. The Facial Action Coding System could be very benificial to students and others. It can help with the problems that might hold them back from doing their best in school. This technology could help identify a student who is happy or worried being able to have fun while using this technology and being able to identify if a student is confused or bored.,0.05

I think my statement is correct because, what else would it be. It is an old face grounded into Mars. It proves there is life on Mars even though it could possibly be an alien. Furthermore, it is either a human being or alien possibly inside this planet with their face sticking out privately. This suspicious face could be anything that was alive at one point. There probably isn't any life on Mars because the photograph was taken from an airship. So it is most likely an alien. If it was a human, he probably died instantly.

My inference now is it is an alien. Because, the face was located 41 degrees north martian latitude. The face seems to be in a very random spot to be seen. My inference is it is an alien. However you never know

e_1r8p9qqv,1,"Dear Mr. Senator,

There are many ways to go about elections of any kind, as you may know vey well seeing that you have been in one or more yourself. This country is about the will of the people supported by their government to excel and achieve the various goals they may very well have. Voting is one of those insintives people revieve, and how it is set up is an important part of that. We should keep relying on the Electoral College to succeed in keeping our country a democracy.

Having the Electoral College is a safe way to ensure that all people in every state get to voice their opinion while still keeping in mind the majority as a priority. As stated by author Richard A. Posner, people vote for a slate of electors, not the president, whom are entrusted to vote for the presidential candidate they represent. The number of electors is determined by the population of the state, which basically means the number of members in that state's House of Representatives and two for the Senate, as stated in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College? This ultimately would provide fair numbers for the overall count without making the smaller states feel insignificant.

Even with the smaller states being fairly included people argue that candidates do not pay attention to them and disreguard their overallvotes so we should switch to popular votes. These accusations may be true in a sense but what is to be expected if they dont account for as much or maybe they are already accounted for as decided, as stated by Richard P. Would you campaign in a place like that? Especially since having elections be decided by popular votes could result in runoff elections to which no clear winner is evident, they would result in a tie, as included by Richard A. Posner. Having a tied election would end up giving the HOR overall election power, as presented in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College, so their arguement is not considerate of all possibly outcomes.

All in all, sticking with the Electoral College seems to be the best bet for our democratic country. Electors are trustworthy, with few faults, and the system is set up in a way that is fair to all.",0.0

e_6fvjegxg,1,"Dear, Senator of Florida I am writing this letter to you about keeping or changing the Electoral College. Changing it would be a better idea because we should have more say in our own country and that is not what America stands for. The Electoral College is unfair and irrational according to Bradford Plumer who wrote ""The Indefensible Electoral Colleges: Why even the best laid defenses are wrong"" in source 1."" Under the elctoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elected the president"". This shows how we don't really get a choice if we want him as president. They do all the choosing.

In Source 3 it says,""...at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states...""this means there isn't any point in voting cause they will just pick their own president. It also means some people feel like there votes aren't counted and therefore make them lose hope in their country.

On the other hand, the electoral college has its good qualities too. In source 2 by Richard A. Posner he said,""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the prresident may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state Democracts in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.""This is saying that sometimes people aren't very interested in the election or in voting at all so they might stop trying altogether. Another reason why its good to keep the electoral collge is in Source 4 when Nate Silver was talking about Obama having a big popular vote win which doesn't mean much because Romney wins the electoral vote. So this proves that it can happen again with different presidents and maybe it won't be fair to the person who had more popular votes.

Keeping the Electoral Collage seems easier than making changes, but imho,its not right. I think everyone should have a say in what happens to our country and the future generations. Thank you for your attention towards my letter and i hope you consider changing the electoral college.",0.9
e_ovqs9ujv,5,"I think that having technology that can read emotions in a class room would be a good idea because it can show where kids tend to feel self consious about certian taskes they are asked to do. Some kids may feel excited to get up in front of their class to do a speech or presentation, while others may feel the need to hide. This can also help with social behaviors by showing how kids react when palying a competive game or trying to get along with others they may not know well.

For kids who tend to be more quite in school communicating can be on the difficult side. By putting these technologies in PC's or other computers, teachers can help those students work on their skills based on where they tend to react. The author takls about how most human interaxtion is nonverbal. Their claim is ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that to."" Dr. Huang wnats to explain that maybe if the game can tell that the child paly is feeling frustated that the game system can help them through until they feel more confident. This kind of technology can indicate whether a person is actually happy or just faking it. The author writes, ""They even indicate the differnece between a genuine smaile and a forced one."" The computers can even go imdepth enough to prove that its faked based on the way that the muscles are reacting. As claimed by the author, ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major muscles that begin at your cheeck bones lift the corners of your mouth."" These emotion readers can indicate where and when a childs emotion can change.

In conclusion, emotion readers can help teachers tell when kids feel differently about something even if they show a different expression. Although people may think they are being watched, adding these feature in school PC's would be a good idea. These features will help get a better understanding of what really puts pressure on students at any age and grade level. This will also help studies to see if somethings that are done in school are too much fo one to handle based on their age and emotions.",0.0
e_df3xw3ru,1,"Dear Senator Senator's Last Name,

I am writing to express my concerns about our current system of electing the President of the United States, which is the electoral college. Some aspects of the electoral college seem outmoded, and I believe that it is important to consider whether we should retain it or transition to a system of electing presidents by popular vote.

The electoral college, as detailed by the Office of the Federal Register, was established in our Constitution as a compromise. It presents a method of election that resides somewhere between selection by the U.S. Congress and pure popular vote passage 1. But Bradford Plumers article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" highlights multiple flaws of the electoral college, such as the potential for faithless electors who vote against the will of the people passage 11.

However, there are strong arguments for keeping the electoral college. Judge Richard A. Posner outlines several reasons, some of which include: a higher certainty of outcome, encouraging candidates to consider all regions of the U.S., focusing campaign efforts on swing states, balancing the political influence of large states, and avoiding the complications of runoff elections passages 1822.

A study mentioned in Plumer's article revealed a majority of U.S. voters would prefer a direct election passage 9. This seems to express a general desire for a more democratic system rooted in popular vote. Yet, paradoxically, moving to a system based solely on the popular vote could lead to negative outcomes. For instance, candidates might focus their campaigning solely on larger, more populous cities, neglecting rural and less populated areas. This is exactly what the electoral college system protects against, as Posner argues that it forces presidential candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters passage 19.

While arguments against the electoral college system involve possible elector problems and bias toward swing states passages 13 & 14, Pasner counters these with the argument that the electoral college provides more certainty of outcome passage 18 and encourages voters in swing states to be more thoughtful and engaged passage 20. 

Our current system ensures that presidents must have broad appeal across regions and that the results are final and immediate, avoiding runoff elections passages 19 & 22. Importantly, for a country as geographically and culturally diverse as ours, this aspect of the electoral college is key in maintaining balance and inclusivity in the process.

To conclude, while there are valid points about the limitations of the Electoral College made by critics, I am of the opinion that it continues to provide the most pragmatic and equitable method for electing our president by ensuring fair regional representation, avoiding runoff elections, and providing a clear outcome. This is an issue that deserves open dialogue and careful thought, and as my representative, I urge you to weigh the merits of this unique system we use to elect our President.",1.0

However, they were not succesfull in the long run due to the harsh conditons. Humans have not gone back to Venus since then. However, NASA, NASA's partner, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, wants us the people to go to Venus. NASA wants us to study Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" NASA is wanting the people to study Venus. They want to study Venus because of the dangers of studying Venus. They want the people to study it because they want to know what Venus' conditions is like in today's world. The author of this article, Garvin, states that it is dangerous but it's a worthy pursuit, and it can be survived.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states in the first paragraph that the planet Venus is a dangerous planet. The author states that it has a thick atmosphere, which is 97 percent carbon dioxide, which is very hot, the planet has erupting volcanoes, and the planet has frequent lighting strikes. The author states in the first paragrapgh that Venus is a very dangerous place to go and study.

The author of the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" states in the fourth paragraph that the temperature would be about 800 degrees Fahrenhiet.

The planet Venus is a dangerous place for humans to study because of the harsh and harsh conditons that are there.

Venus is a dangerous place to study. It is a very dangerous place for humans to study because of the harsh and dangerous conditions it has.

e_fm7t9yva,2,"There has been a lot of debate circling wether or not the infamous ""Face on Mars"" is an actual alien made structure of a face or just a natural landform. In my professional opinion its safe for me to assume it is just a natural landform.

Although it resembled a face in the first picture it doesn't necesarrily mean it was created by life forms to look like a face. The only features you can make out on the socalled ""Face"" are deep holes for eyes, a pointed part for the nose, and a line for the mouth. It doesn't have any distinct features. If if was made my martians they most likely wouldn't want a monument of a human's face so what is it supposed to be? I'll you what it is butte or mesa, a natural landform that is common on Earth.

Another reason you know it isn't a face is the camera quality of the first image. The camera quality in 1976 wasn't as advanved as today's technology is. The pictures in both 1998 and 2001 were both much more clear than the original photograph. Although you can make out somewhat of a face it doesn't mean thats what it was. It could have just been a blurry picture.

Conspriacy theorists say it actually was aliens and they made the face but NASA would greatly benefit from finding actual life on Mars. If NASA found legitimate alien lifeforms it could benefit the whole world. If they were nonhostile they could teach us how to make and use their technology. We could learn a lot from them, like why the landforms on their planet resemble faces. NASA has been trying to find alien life for years, if they found it they woudln't deny them and say they don't exist.

There are a lot of people that think it has to be a face. And the pictures are from 25 years apart, so anything could have happened to the landform in that long. Natural wear and tear could have washed across the surface of it and rendered it a natural landform. In all seriousness they could be right but it would take a lot more than 25 years to ruin solid rock.

The ""Face on Mars"" had a good 25 year run. It was mostly scaring people and giving conspiracy theorists ammunition to shoot at the government to try to get us to admit there is other life out there, but its time to face reality. It is not a face. It really is a landform. If there was life on Mars you could see it with the cameras we have today, but sadly, no such luck. It's not a face on Mars, we just have imaginations that run wild with wonder.",0.0

One of the main reasons to limit car usage is its impact on the environment. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can contribute to climate change. They also produce noise pollution, which can be harmful to human health.

In addition, car ownership can be expensive. The cost of a car, including the purchase price, insurance, and maintenance, can be a major financial burden for many people. The cost of gas can also be a significant expense, especially in areas with high gas prices.

Finally, driving can be dangerous. Car accidents are a leading cause of death in the United States. They can also cause serious injuries, such as paralysis and brain damage.

There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One option is to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. Another option is to carpool or use a ridesharing service. There are also a number of new technologies that can help to reduce car usage, such as selfdriving cars and carsharing apps.

Limiting car usage can have a number of benefits. It can help to reduce air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic congestion. It can also save money and improve public health. In addition, it can make cities more livable and sustainable.

If you are interested in limiting car usage, there are a number of things you can do. You can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. You can carpool or use a ridesharing service. You can also support policies that promote sustainable transportation, such as building more bike lanes and public transportation.

e_41vvsbxd,-1,"When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decisioninto one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time.

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best.

Solar power would be plentiful and nus would not have to worry about a lack in supply,"" But in the previous line you found more information and facts from one statement. In that quote he states what the challenges, you would have to deal when you're up there visiting our very known planet, the Venus, so in my opinion he said it to open the audience ideas about the possibility of what they will find and go through. He explains why no one hasn't walked it yet ""Numerous factors contirbut to tht challenge of examining thjese reasont the National Acronomoy of the US sponsored by NASA is seeking to do just that.

They are dangeour places for us. So in conclusion, you never let down your travel to the planets of our solar system just see ""a few miles further down the road""

The author then goes to say one more challenging idea. It talks about Venues surfaces and it may have been the most Earthlike planer so it could provide a good insight of that type of conditions here before we had air breathling plants life here on Earth. In that quote he quotes, ""The cloud present a challenge for scientists."" In the story i told you before how the clouds over venues ""wash out the value of viewing the ground"" .

Even as i explain the facts that the author is explaining the details it is still a major challenge for the exploration of space and our planet on other planets. One of them is the atmosphere ""thoughts like ""How should NASA prepare explorers to endure the challenge of examanion if they went to that type and the atmosfare was so challenging just to endue it with that much of air pressure on the surface or in the surroundings.""

e_37w8mn43,-3,"What a refreshing idea! When faced with a difficult question or a complicated situation, it is sometimes extremely useful to consult several people. When Senator Caroline expressed her opinion on a guncontrol referendum, the opinions of several people influenced her in her assessment of the two sides of the argument. A deeper understanding of the subject may result. Looking at the question from several points of view enables one to see more clearly and to point out where the Senators may agree. Senator Caroline spoke to both local and foreign gunrights activists she talked to kindergarten teachers, to the psychological counselors of friends of people representing both sides in the referendum. You can often learn from people who are influenced by different schools of thought, the moral principles and the level of education of the people around them, things that they are unable to see in themselves. The result is a deeper understanding of the problem and its likely outcome. To help these processes along, the wisest approach is to display a wise and openminded attitude. If one is attentive and gives credence to the opinions of others, one can help the body of opinion reach collective conclusions at the expense of biasinfluenced personal opinions. One can then make an effort to draw out and combine elements of the different opinions, using these as one of the basis for a rational consideration of the available options.

On April 5 1998 Eightteen years after the Viking 1 and 2 were shut down the Mars Orbiter Camera came into orbit range of Mars and started taking pictures. The team of scientists espiecially focused on getting a picture of the face so they could reveal to public that there was indeed no face on Mars. The picture came back alot more clear and showed that there was no face on Mars therefore stating that there was no ancient civilization that NASA was hiding. On April 8 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take another picture of the face And this time the scientists angled it perfectly so they had the best possible picture to stop all the nonsense about the face on Mars. They took the picture and enhanced it three times the size. This picture the the the picture and it found that the face was actually a martian mesa and a mesa. In conclusion, there was actually face on Mars And NASA NASA that it was just a landform which there are many ofs around the entire planet of Mars.",0.05

First of all, on many trips you can die very quickly or wound on Venus as many natural events are like an outbreak and storm, but there may still be many banfits to explore Venus. Some banfits include.That humans cannot observe Venus inactive from the ship because Venus is sometimes surrounded by clouds so that despite the risks .No has to get the right to the subject in the person. To learn more about the Palm or other planets like it, we have to be willing to put in hours.Venus on the planet is many risks that come with landing.

Although there may be many risks to each problem, there may be solutions to fix them.",1.0
e_3r2ri945,-1,"In my opinion I think that students should do some type of activity like a sport or join the student council. I agree because it will give you something to do in your free time, make new friends and have fun with people who share the same interest as you.

First off if you participate in an after schoolactivityit will give you something to do when your bored at home. If your parents are gone they won't worry about where you might be if you are doing a club. Some clubs can also help your future job for example if you want to become a doctor when you grow up you would join the medical team so you know how everything works before becoming one yourself. Also many of these clubs will teach you what to do if there is a real emergency and how to treat it. For instance if someone gets hurt at practice the coach will teach the players how to handle it instead of panicking.

Secondly joining clubs will help you meet new people who like what you enjoy. It helps you make friendswithin the group and if needed could get you a ride from them if your parent's aren't around. You may even find out you both live close by each other which means you guys could hangout outside of club time. Clubs usually always go on field trips together as wellwhich gives everyone a chance to bond while having fun. In my experience I used to play volleyballbut now I don't anymore, but we still keep in touch today even though we only played once. She has taught me how to sew and knit since she loves those hobbies and i just love being able to hangout with her whenever she isn't busy.

Lastly all sports teams and clubs do stuff for fun such as tournaments and competitions. The winners get medals and certificates and bragging rights over their rivals. Most clubs and teams hold parties too during the year and sometimes for special events like Christmas or Halloween. Even if you aren't in a club or participating in any sports, you can still celebrate holidays with your friends or family. Having a good time with people you care about makes life more interesting and keeps things exciting and fun.

To conclude my thoughts I believe students should be forced into doing at leastone extra curricular club, team or activity because its great for meeting new people, staying active and finding something you really like to do. They also help you stay focused and have less distractions. All of this leads to having a lotof fun and learning something new everyday.",0.9

e_hon7udjx,-2,"China's central bank chief has said that inflation would be a modest seven percent this year and this showed the state's economic policies were working.
But Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, lashed out at companies that had taken advantage of tight money policies used to tackle inflation by lending money at excessively high rates.
""The appropriately tight monetary polices have achieved clear results which have been acknowledged both in China and abroad,"" Dai was quoted as saying in the Financial News on Monday.
""We can now control inflation to about seven percent for the full year,"" he said.
China's retail inflation stood at 6.9 percent yearonyear in the first seven months and at 5.9 percent in July alone.
Beijing has said it wanted to keep inflation within 10 percent for 1996, down from 14.8 percent last year and a communistera high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
But the central bank chief had harsh words for companies that had taken advantage of the tough austerity programme put in place three years ago to deal with the worst days of inflation.
He did not name any of the offenders but he said that some ""monopoly groups"" and publicly listed companies were lending out money at excessively high rates.
Tsingtao Brewery, which has stock listed in Hong Kong as well as in Shanghai, has run afoul of regulatory authorities in the British colony in the past for lending out funds raised from its public offer.
A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named said several big ministries were cashrich and able to earn more than bank deposit rates by lending out their funds.
""The big offenders are some cashrich ministries,"" said the economist. ""They can earn 1618 percent on their money.""
That would compare with interest of 7.47 percent earned on oneyear bank deposits.
Other economists have said that higher rates were available for even more speculative lending.
Dai gave no indication of whether any measures were being planned to address these problems, although he said that funds in the banking system were unevenly distributed.
He said that China had already taken steps to curb illegal money market trade and that it had taken steps to ensure that other unauthorised financial organisations did not act as commercial banks.
""There are many violations of financial regulations,"" Dai was quoted as saying. ""There must be an expansion of supervision over the financial sector.",0.0

e_dvmefjpl,2,"In 1976, NASA took a picture of the face on mars. The face was a huge hit and everybody started talking about it. Some people thought that aliens built this but others think that is just a natural landform. I am going to give you my opinion so we can clear up some things. We will look at all of the evidence and see if aliens really did build this or not.

My first reason why i think it's not an alien made monument is because how would they have made it? Aliens don't even exist so there is no way for them to make something like that with their hands. They couldnt use tools either cause they dont exist. If aliens were real then there are probably more than one and they would have made different ones around the planet.

Another reason why i think its not an alien monument is because in 2001, Garvin flew over Cydonia again to take another photo of the face. When he got back to his office he found out what every body else found out, it was just a natual land form. So that means that everything that everyone thought before was wrong!

I hope by now you believe me when i say it's not an alien monument. It might be hard to believe but i promise you that it's true. There has been plenty of research done on these ""alien monuments"" and none of them ended up being anything important. You should always do your own reserch instead of believing random stuff off the internet.",0.9
e_zpme978o,-3,"People think differently. They get information from their surroundings, and this information will lead to different conclusions. Taking the advice of others is also a very important life skill. This will make people understand better and make wiser decisions. The British Harris Interactive study found that adults in Britain recommend therapy, talking with a friend, and psychological investment activities, and are willing to seek and give moral support. People are obsessed with the consequences of a particular state of mind and emotion, and they are working hard to make it happen, or they are following the advice that is too similar, so they have to do it. The results are not that important. In this case, our cultural inclination is to take the relevance into consideration, and the advice is given based on too much shared experience. However, people's experience and beliefs vary, and the quality of advice is mainly determined by the different experiences and beliefs of different people. There are people who can easily empathize with the facts, and they can also empathize with the chaos of life, but they must have their own morals, which should be interpreted in terms of the fate of the population, and the story must make sense in the future. This kind of thing is just a manifestation of the deep dependence on others' ideas, and it is also a manifestation of creative thoughts that are able to trust others, so it can be used as a tool for thinking, and it will be used for a lifetime of stimulation and survival. In the end, we also know that the missionaries will look to Mecca for support, so the foundation is based on consultation, and it will be determined after gaining its impression as the ultimate entity, which is the rule of the reason among the resources that are constantly refreshed by the experts. They think that the successful exploration of ideas and concepts will achieve a certain legitimacy and selfrespect, and it will be a great disaster if it is not maintained by the relevant personnel, but it will only make people ignore their own mind and emotions, which will gradually be led to the breakdown of their own personality and psyche. Although the view of others is usually a little suspicious, especially in the era of technological development, it is also inevitable to let the idealism of a generation slip away.",1.0
e_c4vermey,0,"Citizens are often using cars to get from work and back, however if citizens were to stop using cars there could be some advantages like traffic can be reduced, new buildings can be built, and habits of car use can be stopped.

If citizens were to cut down on using cars traffic would be reduced. According to Robert Duffer a person from the Chicago Tribune he states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Robert Duffer, paragraph 14. With that being stated by Robert Duffer it should be clear to people that with reduced traffic people are able to get to places where they need to be in just a short matter of time, citizens won't have to worry about being late for whatever it is citizens have to do. Robert Duffer also states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters 12 Citizens should realize that with almost 4,000 people being fined it should tell citizens that they should cut down on car usage to help prevent smog and to also save them money.

Along with citizens cutting down on car usage to reduce traffic if they were to cut car usage new building can be built. According to Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times he states that ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitty sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Andrew Selsky, paragraph 28. When citizens cut down on car usage many new things can be built and explored by citizens but if citizens were to not stop car usage then new things wouldn't be built and old things couldn't be replaced or fixed. Andrew Selsky also states that it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths 27. There is many citizens out in the world that would rather ride bikes than to use a car just to prevent pollution, with 118 miles of bicycle paths there shouldn't really be any car use. Using bicycles could help change the world so much more and less pollution could be created.

Not only with citizens cutting down on car use for new buildings to be built, citizens can stop their habits of car usage if they give it a try. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal a lady from the New York Times she states that ""with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession may find less reason to resume the habit"" Elisabeth Rosenthal, paragraph 36.Citizens stopping car commuting could really help those citizens with habits of not being able to stop car commuting which could result in saving the earth and air pollution. Elisabeth also states that a chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety 43. While the chairman of the Ford Motor Company is stating this information maybe citizens will change their minds about car usage just to improve safety or to even safe time.

All in all this why citizens should car usage to reduce traffic, new buildings can be built, and to try and stop habits of car use by giving it a try. Citizens trying to do these could help stop air pollution and they could also save themselves money.",0.0
e_dm7lq1yj,0,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including concerns about the environment, traffic congestion, and the cost of owning a car.

There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are one of the main sources of air pollution, and by driving less, we can all help to improve the air quality in our cities. Second, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can be very frustrating for drivers. By driving less, we can help to ease congestion and make it easier to get around. Third, limiting car usage can help to save money. Cars can be expensive to buy, insure, and maintain. By driving less, we can save money that can be used for other things.

Of course, there are also some challenges associated with limiting car usage. For example, it can be difficult to get around without a car in some areas. Additionally, some people may not be willing to give up their car for the sake of the environment or traffic congestion.

Despite these challenges, I believe that the advantages of limiting car usage outweigh the disadvantages. If we can all make an effort to drive less, we can make a real difference for the environment, traffic congestion, and our wallets.

Here are some additional details on the advantages of limiting car usage:

 Reducing air pollution. Cars are one of the main sources of air pollution, and by driving less, we can all help to improve the air quality in our cities. Air pollution is a major problem that can cause a number of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. By reducing air pollution, we can improve our health and the health of our children.
 Reducing traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can be very frustrating for drivers. By driving less, we can help to ease congestion and make it easier to get around. Traffic congestion can waste time and fuel, and it can also contribute to air pollution. By reducing traffic congestion, we can make our lives easier and more enjoyable.
 Saving money. Cars can be expensive to buy, insure, and maintain. By driving less, we can save money that can be used for other things. Car ownership can be a major financial burden, and by driving less, we can reduce this burden. We can use the money we save on car expenses to pay for other things, such as travel, education, or retirement savings.

In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of limiting car usage outweigh the disadvantages. If we can all make an effort to drive less, we can make a real difference for the environment, traffic congestion, and our wallets.",1.0
e_ssvrjlwq,-3,"This is what is expected of both the driver and the car. We will rely on technology and not human abilities to keep both the driver and the car safe. When a human error does occur on the road, it will be brought to the attention of the expert drivers and at once corrected with the help of the drivers. In this new age of car manufacture, it is more important to minimize human error than to make each car as safe as possible, for only the optimum selfcontrol can be maintained by the cars. In short, the notion of human drivers seems to be a throwback from earlier insecurity about driving. However, the driverless car will transform the lives of human beings in ways no one can imagine. The future of the car is in cars without drivers, which will be as safe as the modern aircraft. As Robert Hallgren says, Only time will tell. See Robert Hallgren on en.wikipedia.org.",1.0
e_ctnfmcdc,-1,"If doing online courses or classes at home help students a lot more with their everyday life, is it really helpful to attend those things? Today I will discuss my argument on why online courses would definitely benefit students in their lives.

Waking up every weekday morning to go to class can be a hassle for some or even most students, but having to do online courses can stop you from waking up every morning to get to class before 7:20 am. The reason why I agree with this idea is that it benefits students who have to work at home or do other things in their life that can help them prepare for college courses or even multitasking alone. If you have to go to work at the morning while having a paper or even a project due the same way, you don't have to go to class in the morning. You'll miss your work and have to schedule for another time to clock in and it will be a whole mess for you if you don't have a online course. If you're a high school student and you don't have a job or anything else important for you to do all the time, you'll still benefit from having 8 hour classes then online courses.

Now, safety is the most important thing when it comes to your everyday life as an individual, so students going to school every morning, on a weekday, going from class to class until their 8 hours are up can very much raise their concerns about their safety and how they can prevent themselves from getting hurt. Students come to school making sure the school protects them while they are in their classes building up and getting their careers ready when they step foot out the school. If their can be one way to prevent those concerns, it has to be online courses. You don't want to have a call one day talking about your child being hurt while you're away at work, you wouldn't want to take your child back to school after what happened cause the school didn't do their job of protecting your kid while you were away. Thats why doing online courses will be a lot more safer and helpful for you as a parent. Doing an online course can reduce how much you have to pay when it comes to going to school.

The most important to me when it comes to an online course is that it can help me or even other students to be on their own and have more of a responsibility at home or wherever we are. Now I understand that you don't have to do online courses cause it doesn't help you focus or even give you as much of a responsibility when it comes to school things, but even some of the things we do in school can be really dumb and not give us as much of a purpose as to why we are doing what were are doing. If I was to get into a fight with someone, I would have to get detention or ISS or even be suspended or expelled, as to online, that won't be a problem cause i'm not going to be around no one or even be mad at someone because of something so dumb that shouldn't be the reason to why I came to school or even force myself into having a career or even an education. School is a way to understanding in the real world, as much as math or other things won't benefit me as much when I go out there and do what i've always wanted to do, it will still be important to me in my life.

Attending classes from home can benefit me and others in many different ways, but having to do so, there should be a responsibility to take while having to do online courses. Now, in the future, there should be a online course for all schools so there can be less of a safety hazard to students and less of a hassle when attending a public or private school.",0.0
e_8hq8vuub,5,"The new technology called the ""Facial Coding Sytem""is the best technology ever. It has a veriety of features like the 3D model,the recognizition emotion face,annd the math homework app .

The 3D model is one way why people should choose this technology because if you have a 3D model computer then everything looks big and clear. This proves that now and days people like to watch thing and look at things big and clear. So that is why you should take this technology.

The recognize emotion is another reason why this is a nice technology. For example,this shows how you feel or the way you expressions look. The author says,""Using video imagery,the new emotionrecognition software tracks these facial movementsin real life or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.""This proves that the facial emotion can work on anything whether is a person or a picture of someone.

The math homework is the last reason why you should buy this technology. In fact this is also a part of the emotion senser like whether if you feel like doing it or not. For examle,in the text it says,""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotionslike mathwork.""This proves that the technology can tell if we want to do something or not. Emotion in the new technology can really determine a person.

In conclusion,The emotion,homework and 3D computer are the best features to have on a technology and people would love it too if they had want to get one.",0.0
e_fh3znp4s,-2,"Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives is a work by Philippa Foot that attempts to question Kants idea of morality. Kant claims that moral judgment cannot be a hypothetical imperative instead, it is a categorical and universal imperative. Foot argues that morality should be presented as a system of hypothetical imperatives due to the fact that morality does not differ from anything else, for example, etiquette.
The idea of morals being driven by the categorical imperatives implies that morality takes a different kind of the word should. By comparing morality with etiquette, Foot claims that there is no significant distinction between the two Foot, 1972. She draws an example of a person not caring for some etiquette rules is not excused for violating them Foot, 1972. As such, Foot concludes that since morality and etiquette can both use categorical imperatives, the should of etiquette and the should of moral judgment are similar.
Next, Foot proceeds to dispute the reason behind following the moral rules. According to Foot 1972, a moral rule can be irrational for a person to commit to, marking this person as amoral or evil however, not irrational. As such, being able to withdraw from committing to these rules for whatever reason, no matter how it renders the person, means moral rules are hypothetical imperatives, not categorical Foot, 1972. Vice versa, people can and do act morally, despite not being binding to do so. However, Foot concludes that if the moral judgment is a hypothetical imperative, then there must be other reasons why people decide to stay moral Foot, 1972. Such reasons can be the hypothetical imperative of desire for justice, charity, liberty, and other virtues.",0.0
e_2batp6zb,5,"I think that using the Facial Action Coding system is not a good idea because ..why would you want a computer to go and scan and tell if its ok for you to get one? i dony know why they would need a computer to help them because they probaly will not get it right and the teachers wont know it either if they are going mad or happy.

In the article it states ""The Facial Action Coding System can even identify mixed emotion  like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" , why would they buy it if they dont need to tell them because they are just going to have to go to their ad in the computer and they probaly not even know how to do it.

 but im pretty sure it is worth spending alot of money to get one of these computers, just to make sure yall know how it works. People are not going to need a computer in there social worker soical worker there to tell them how to do it. If they dont need it then thats not the case because they will have somebody that has it with them in the classroom and the teacher can just send the computer to look for them and tamper with it "". But why would they go get one if they cant have it out in there in the classroom to check their problem and help them out. Also they can use it in the school computers but not the classroom because its like they need it to see whats wrong with it.  it would be nice if the people who are doing all of these things could talk to the computer and see what there emotional state is .But i honestly think it would be better to let a computer tell them that if it is not going to be good to have to come to your school it will not help them in any way.",0.7
e_ss26qjru,3,"Luke's point of view is that if you want to see different places then it might be a good idea. He thought it was an opportunity of a lifetime. If you like being on a ship and sailing around the world this job would be perfect for you. Luke said ""the cattleboat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy""

If you have never been in Europe or China, maybe its time to go. It could be something fun to do with your friends. The passages across the Atlantic ocean took two weeks. But it took much longer to get to china. In 1947 they had made nine trips the most any Seaman has ever done. Luke liked seeing all the diffrent places like Venice Italy and Corinth Greece.

He also got to take tours when he went to these places. They played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals used to live. You can play other things too but those are some examples of what you can do.

e_azs5xwuy,-1,"Should people be able to use their phone while they're driving? I think that no one should have the right to do that. The reason why is because it would increase accidents, a lot more of deaths will happen and you can get in trouble if caught by police or other authorities. In my opinion, i don't believe anyone should have permission to texting and driving at all.

First off, using your cellphone while behind the wheel can lead to an accident. It may seem like you are paying attention but most likely not. You could swerve into another lane, go over speed limit, etc. If someone were to be hurt, you could end up with serious charges and jail time. Your life could change dramatically as well. Not only for yourself but also your family. Many things could possibly occur when you decide to pick up your phone.

Also, there has been a lot of reports where a person gets killed due to being distracted by their phone. When this happens, the driver who hit them has to deal with many consequences. They could lose their job, pay a large amount of money from insurance, even face criminal charges depending on the situation. This incident could leave them with a bad reputation which might affect their career. It wouldn't matter how much experience he or she had. No one wants something like this to happen so just put down your device.

Lastly, getting pulled over by the police isn't fun either. There's always the chance of getting stopped whether you were doing something wrong or just suspicious looking. Texting and driving leaves room for mistakes. Mistakes that come along with a fine. Fines aren't really cheap these days especially if its related to driving. Depending on what state you live in, it could cost a couple hundred dollars to pay back. So avoid any complications and keep your eyes open.

In conclusion, i highly suggest keeping both hands on the steering wheel. Even though sometimes you may need to grab your phone, try waiting until you arrive at your destination. It'll save you a lifetime worth of problems.",0.9

I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appauled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitutiondecades ago. The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical. I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential canidate, they are not. Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president. Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions? Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives canidates different motives for their campaign. I believe that in an electoral campaign, canidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting. However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by canidates, as if they don't matter, so that the canidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from. In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the canidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad. If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded? It makes sense for the canidates to see ""swing states""the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another. I don't blame the canidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting. For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which canidate the state's electoral votes will be going to. People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way. The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting. Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, onehalf of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not. I'm sure that a good portion of nonvoters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issuesissues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system. Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place. With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.",0.0

Have you ever been bored at home and wanted to do something fun? Well, if your principle made everyone participate in an after school activity then there wouldn't be a problem. Making students take part in one of the clubs or sports would improve them socially. They could meet new people with similar interests as themselves. Also, it would help them get exercise and stay fit so they don't have health issues later on in life. Most importantly it would give them something else to think about besides their regular school work so that when they go back home they won't feel like doing nothing all day. If I was the principal I definitely would make my students take part in a club or sport because i know how boring sitting around at home can be for some kids.

Its very important for us humans to interact with each otherbecause we need friends and family support. If someone has trouble making friends then joining a club is a great way to meet people who have similar interest as yourself. It helps create bonds between peers which creates trust. Trust is needed in order to become closer friends and eventually best friends. That person may also end up being your partner someday down the road. So its really good to form relationships while your still young. In addition, having more than one friend will bring joy into our lives. Just look at any kid playing catch by themselves outside he probably isn't as happy as him and his buddy throwing the ball back and forth. When your in school all day long it can be hard trying to find someone with common interest but when you join a club or play a sport thats easy to accomplish. You can even choose what type of sport you want to play whether its baseball or soccer the choice is yours. Therefore, participating in an after school activity benefits the relationship between individuals.

In today's society obesity is becoming a big issue because most people are either eating too much food or not getting enough exercise. Either way your putting your body through stress. When your stressed out you tend to eat bad foods to comfort your self. Some examples are fast food burgers or pizzas just anything that tastes good. But all these things have high levels of sodium in them and once consumed our bodies start retaining water causing swelling and fatigue. This process is called bloating. If your overweight this is going to be more apparent. Thats why we should all try to keep active. Joining a club like chess club or yearbook club can help with mental exercises. Sports such as football or soccer can help with cardiovascular excercises. Doing both types of excercise keeps your brain sharp and focused and lets you sleep better at night. Plus studies show that the less sleep you get the more likely your gonna gain weight. Overall staying active is key to living a healthy lifestyle.

When we come home from school sometimes we dont have much to do and we just sit around watching TV or texting on our phones. I mean sure those things aren't bad every now and again but its nice to switch things up every so often. By forcing students to partake in an after school activity gives them something else to think about and makes time flyby faster. Say your playing basketball or soccer with your teammates it gets your mind off of school stuff and just focuses on whats happening right now. Like when youre shooting a basket in basketball you only focus on making the shot instead of worrying about the test coming up next week. Its kind of therapeutic almost like yoga where you clear your mind and relax your body. A lot of teachers actually use this technique during class when were working on a project. They tell us to close our eyes and think of a place far away from here or think of one thing that calms you down. For example the beach or maybe a forest. Once your done with that they say open your eyes and let everything flood back in. Then you can continue focusing on your task at hand. As you can see this method works very well especially when your tired or hungry. Now imagine this but extended for hours. The perfect combination of relaxation and excercising.

So yes I believe that all students should have to take part in an after school activity. It improves social skills among children and teenagers. It reduces the amount of sedentary behavior which results in obese kids. Lastly it gives students another reason to smile everyday.",0.9
e_3w1gugb2,6,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a strong case for studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. Using details from the article, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea.

The author begins by making the case that Venus is an important target for exploration. She points out that Venus is the most similar planet to Earth in terms of size, mass, and gravity. She also notes that Venus has an atmosphere that is similar to Earth's, which could make it a valuable place to study the effects of climate change.

The author then goes on to discuss the dangers of exploring Venus. She points out that the temperature on Venus is very hot, and that the atmospheric pressure is so high that it would be difficult for a human to survive. She also notes that the surface of Venus is covered in acid rain and sulfuric acid.

Despite these dangers, the author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. She points out that we have learned a great deal about Earth by studying other planets in our solar system. She also argues that we need to study Venus in order to learn more about our own planet.

I agree with the author that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. I think it is important to study all of the planets in our solar system in order to learn more about our own planet. I also think that it is important to study Venus in order to learn more about the effects of climate change.",1.0
e_402h8iah,5,"I think it is valuable to use this technology in schools or where ever there is they want to know more about them based on their face on other people because you can't always know if your friends are happy or what they are feeling based on their face on a day to day bases.

Since some kids dont really tell you whats going on in their life and if they are sad or mad they wont tell you what they are feeling. So I think you can use these. I think students will find very interesting these computers because they have 3D models that can read faces and every little muscle of their face to make predictions like a guess in order to see the facial expressions you make when the computer recognises your face to see if you like something or not like the ads on your phone!

If you like something it shows more like those you just watched but sometimes In my opinion feel like it just wants you to stay on your phone and kepp being on it and I find it kind of creepy that it watches your face and the way you react. But I think most kids and other people would like it in a cool way to use. Just like they tried using it on the Mona Lisa painting to see what she was feeling back then because she looked like she was very mad at something.

But other wise i think it will be great and i think they should use them in schools. I find it very interesting for other students and myself to use and they should put it in all schools.",0.326793869164812

Once upon a time, in the mystical realm of Eldoria, existed a young scribe named Amelia. Gifted with a vivid imagination and a renowned storytelling ability, ohe possessed the remarkable power to bring her tales to life. The enchanting land she had crafted through her words was beloved by many, but there was one prompt that had always stood out as her favorite.
The prompt that inspired this cherished story wao: In a world where mirrors reflect more than just appearances, a young girl discovers a hidden realm within her reflection.
Amelia's favorite tale began with a young girl named Eliza, who lived in a modest cottage on the outskirts of the village. With an extraordinary curiosity and boundless determination, Eliza yearned for adventure beyond the eimitations of her ordinary life.
One day, while gazing into her grandmother'i antique mirror, Eliza saw something peculiar flicker across its surface. It was as if a hidden mesiage lingered within the looking glass, beckoning her to embark on a fantastical journey.
Casting caution aside, Eliza bravely reached out and touched the mirror. To her astonishment, the surface rippled like water, and she found herself being pulled into a secret world that existed within her reflection.
It was a realm known as Mirrosa, a place where mirrors were sacred portals, connecting countless worlds and dimensions. Eliza discovered she was not the first curious traveler to stumble upon this captivaaing reaam. Many creatureo, both benign and malevolent, dwelled within Mirrosa, each possessing unique abilities linked to the mirrors ehat connected their worlds.
Guided by her newfound mirror companion, Elysia, Eliza embarked on a queot to restore balance and harmony within Mirrosa. Throughout her journey, she encountered extraordinary beingi, including glistening water sprites, fiery phoenixes, and mischievous shadow creatures. They all played a part in revealing the true purpose of her arrival.
Eliza learned that, long ago, an ancient evil had cast a dark enchanament upon Mirrosa, causing chaos and despair to infiltrate every corner. It was her destiny to unravel the mystery behind the evil's origin and restore tranquility io the realm.
With every challenge Eliza faced, the strength within her grew. She discovered thae her power to communicate through stories held immense influence within Mirrosa, as the inhabitants drew inspiration from her narratives to fight against the darkness that plagued their lands.
As Eliza journeyed further, she encountered the malevolent entity responoible for the incursion of evil. Known as the Cursed Entity, ii was a twisted reflection of her own doubts and fears. The battle that ensued became an epic clash beiween darkness and light, each represented by Eliza's unwavering resolve and the strength of those she had touched in her tales.
In a climactic showdown, Eliza tapped into the true potentiae of her storytelling, weaving a narrative of hope and redemption so powerful that it shataered the Cursed Eneity into a thousand pieces. As the fragmented darkness dissipated, the realm of Mirrosa was restored to its former glory, an enchanting aapestry woven from Eliza's courage, ingenuity, and unwavering belief in the magic of words.
Upon returning home, Eliza found her omall village forever changed. Inspired by her tales, the villagers valued stories as fuel for their own dreams. They recognized the transformative power of imagination and began to craft their adventures within their daily liveo.
And so, Eaiza's tale became the favorite bedtime otory for generations to come. The prompt that had sparked this beloved narrative had become a vessel of inipiration itself, reminding people that the greatest adventures lie within the depths of their own souls.
Stories, Amelia realized, were not merely words on a page, but portals to worlds waiting to be liveda reflection of the stories yet untoed within each one of us.

e_tob5zyi2,6,"In the story Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is one of the brightest points in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargaze to spot. The nickname was misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Often referred to as Earth's ''twin'' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus is sometimes around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. On the planet's surface,temperature average over 800 degress Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own plant. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Long ago Venus was maybe or probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Studying to meet the challange presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

e_2eopmeb2,2,"The ""face"" on Mars was first found it was in 1976. At first, it was said that the face was made from an alien or aliens once they inhabit the planet, however it was later found to be only a shadow from another mesa near by. This theory has been dismissed due to new evidence from NASA's mars rover. These high resolution cameras and 3D mapping has showed that this rock formation is just natural landform on mars. It also showed other features in the area, like pyramids which were also believed by the ufo enthusiasts that they are made by aliens aswell.
In the 70's Viking 1 spacecraft photographed the face but the scientists had dismissed it at first as just another normal rock, until some UFO enthusiast has claimed that this could be a proof of alien civilization. NASA has later made a caption saying that it resembles human face formed by shadow to get public's attention towards mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has been a pop icon since then as some people believed this was a bonafide proof that there was a civilization or life in the planet in the past. It even reached hollywood and the grocery stores with people making shirts with faces on them.
Although the most of scientist doesnt believe that it's made by an alien, NASA still thought it was worthwhile taking the image of Cydonia again, just in case it is not shadow or mesa, but a real evidence for life on mars. Then when MGSMars global surveyor took a picture of the cydonia in 1979 at a much more detailed and clearer. It was proven then that this face was indeed a mesa, it was only natural, a common landform on mars. But some ufo believer said it wasnt good enough, they claimed the ufo was only photographed during winter when the clouds are common and obscured parts of mesa which was why the ufo was not found. However NASA did not dismiss it easily this time, the mission controllers had tried again in September 1979 with same results. 
Mission control team at NASA was determined to take a picture again when MGS flyover the Cydonia region of mars during autumn or spring time, so that the light and shadows are at their best. They took another picture in September 2016, but this time they took 20 images and merge them into one large panorama of 10,036 X 5,018 pixels, making it one of the highest resolution view of cydonia ever. However this time they have proven again that it's just natural landforms, there wasnt no evidence that the rock is a sign of ufo or alien presence in Mars.
In conclusion I believed that this face in mars isnt evidence of ufo or alien, however this could also be just another one evidence on how people are very much convinced and believe in something, they tend to have faith. I mean this can also prove on how the humans can have blind faith on whatever they believe in.",1.0
e_0124svh7,6,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploering Venus,"" the author states many reasons why venus is worth studying. The author supports this claim by giving facts and statistics about how close it would be to study Venus if we could survive on its surface. He also goes into detail about NASA's ideas for further research that will allow them to safely explore Venus without any danger of death or injury to their equipment. Finally he gives some details about the type of environment that Venus has in order to give us an idea about what challenges they might face while trying to conduct tests there.

The first reason that the author provides as to why Venus should be studied despite all odds against it, is because it was once thought to have been Earthlike long ago. In paragraph 3, he says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" This is important information because if scientists can figure out a way to go back in time and see what happened to Venus, then we can hopefully find ways to prevent it from happening again here on Earth. It is also possible that if something similar happens again here, that scientist will know how to handle it better than they did before because they learned so much from studying Venus.

Another reason that Venus should be studied is that there are more things to learn about Venus itself nowadays. They have found more evidence that makes them think that there used to be life on Venus. In paragraph 4, the author writes, ""Today, Vens still has some features that are analogous to those on earth...The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" If there were really some life forms living on Venus at one point, then scientists need to find out when that happened and why they died off or where they went. They also need to try and determine whether or not these creatures lived underground or above ground and in what conditions they thrived under. All of this valuable information needs to be figured out in order for mankind to make sure that doesn't happen again to Earth someday.

Finally, the author gave details in paragraphes 7 and 8 about what kind of conditions exist on Venus right now. There are many dangers present in Venus' atmosphere such as high levels of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid rain along with extreme temperatures which average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These factors alone cause many problems for anything wanting to land on its surface and take samples of rock and gas. One example given is that if someone wanted to use a mechanical computer on Venus made up of silicon carbide, that the heat would melt it instantly causing it to cease working after only mere minutes of operation. Also, the pressure is around 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth every day. With pressures like that, it is hard to imagine anyone getting past the surface without dying almost immediately afterwards. However, these issues do not deter researchers from finding new ways to get around these problems and maybe even set foot on Venus someday soon.

After reading this passage about why Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers, I am convinced that the author does indeed support his claim very well throughout the whole text. Not only does he provide valid reasons behind his thoughts, but he also backs them up with solid examples of proofs supporting each fact he brings up. Through all of the dangers mentioned, it is evident that the author believes that the benefits of exploring Venus far surpass the risks associated with doing so. Therefore, I believe that the author successfully supported his statement throughout this entire passage.",0.9

In paragraph eleven i say we want to promote a new way to travel which is in a way to take all motorvial transportation off limited to passanges cars only two types a dublication system, and bus which will save the resources in the earth as well and we need it.

The benefits for doing so is good you wouuldnt have to buy as much gasoline and other stuff to help to the enviroment stay safe, also not having to wake up and driving all the way there, the traffic and waiting it gets very tedius when to much stuff is on the way and its making you go over time getting you to where your driving.

There are a bunch of other good factors such as it might even make you happy knowing the way it works you get your benefits when you use it so go out have your fun in the sun just keep in mind all the reasons that we are telling to why this is good.

The only bad reasons in this paragraph is how long does the wait take to ride a bike and that it might not feel like your getting out somewhere that feels like you could get you wherever you need to be, i do reccomend bicycle and bicycle is very very helpful it will do good for you on your journey to help save the enviroment but be mindful on the time you might spend riding and just how its supposed to come so in conclusion there are both a good and bad in riding a bike and if it is an emergency or in a situation with friends i recommed this one.",1.0

The Face on Mars is the same height as landforms on Earth, so, it has to be natural because it has the same height as regular landforms. I can tell this because in the article it says that it can be a rock or a lava dome. If it was made by aliens then why would they make it look like a rock or a lava dome?

The Face on Mars is the same height as landforms on Earth. I think it is the same height because it has the same height as a mesa, ""A lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa"" 2.

e_3e4kjcp2,-2,"Introduction
Evaluation information is one of the main factors in decisionmaking in various spheres of public life. The data containing results of evaluation procedures gives a specific characteristic of the advantages and disadvantages of various processes, working performance of employees, the effectiveness of production, and more. Therefore, the requirements for the evaluation methods are high as they should be reliable to serve as the basis for introducing changes, revealing weaknesses, and constructing new strategies for the development of different life spheres. Although evaluation information may be subjective or nonrepresentative, it is an essential source of concentrated facts, which is crucial for people of different professions to make quick decisions when it is necessary.
Evaluation Process from the Integrated Theory of Influence Perspective
Evaluation as human activity has several factors that influence it and have affected its forming in the past. Firstly, it is a language used for evaluation, which affects the perception of all the judgments and interpretations and thus predetermines the effect of such evaluation Kirkhart, 2000. Concerning the unique elements of the language that allow evaluators to express their opinion in a certain way, suspending goals regarding peoples opinion on the information, they can even be invisible Hopson, 2000. Therefore, the process of evaluation itself can be affected negatively by the evaluators who use it unfairly.
Concerning the development of the evaluation as a process that triggers essential consequences, the main point in its evolution is the following. An integrated theory of influence was designed to create a new framework for evaluation processes and make them more profound Kirkhart, 2000. The theory regards three aspects  source of influence, intention, and time frame Kirkhart, 2000, p. 8. An integrated theory of influence considers both the process of evaluating its repercussions or using the evaluation information.
Evaluation information is helpful in numerous situations as assessment of any kind always leads to consequences such as making decisions and triggering changes. Concerning the theory of influence, this type of information has a wide range of implementation opportunities. Kirkhart 2000 mentions two types of influence of the evaluation information on all the connected spheres  processbased and resultsbased. Hence, although the interpretation of evaluation results is a separate process, evaluation information determines the directions of future development of both the processes operational performance and goals strategic performance.
Moreover, evaluation information can affect different processes through another aspect related to it  intention. This means that the intentions of the primary evaluation process are not less important than the process itself because they partly reflect the purposes of the evaluator Hopson, 2000. In other words, the evaluation intentionally depends on the purposes of the person who performs it Kirkhart, 2000. Thus, stakeholders of the evaluation process may affect its result by placing the particular request.
On the other hand, the influence of the intention of the evaluation process is not limited by the case described above. According to Kirkhart 2000, the intention of affecting the processes connected to the object of evaluation may be unintended. More specifically, this kind of influence is even more influential and may cause more powerful and profound changes than the intended evaluation. Therefore, stakeholders of the evaluation process may be affected in a completely unexpected way, meaning that evaluation is a phenomenon that evaluators cannot fully control although they initiate it.
Additionally, the influence of evaluation may differ depending on the time. To be more exact, evaluation consequences may vary in a shortterm and longterm perspective and diverge drastically Kirkhart, 2000. However, this fact only highlights the significance of evaluation information and its functionality for the party that uses it. Hence, management of the business, members of state structures, and ordinary people may experience the effect of the assessment in a wide range of ways, unexpectedly, at any time, because it cannot be controlled.
The usefulness of evaluation is best expressed by the fact that it is widely utilized by the business. Pinch 2009 claims it is hard to think of an organization that does not use evaluation. However, regarding business, evaluation processes often become overused, making evaluation information not a valuable tool of performance assessment but a negatively perceived obligatory routine Pinch, 2009. At the same time, if the evaluation takes place regularly and the gathered information is systematized, the evaluation turns into research that can be helpful for business or any other interested party Pinch, 2009. Hence, the factor is substantial for the effectiveness of the evaluation procedure and its positive impact on the assessed unit because it reflects the level of devotion of people to their sphere of activity. Moreover, the higher is the level of professionality of the person who interprets the evaluation data, and the better are the perspectives of the assessed object. In other words, people affect the evaluation outcomes more powerfully than they assume in both positive and negative ways.
Evaluation is an essential instrument in research and drawing conclusions. Therefore the evaluation of informational research systems may have broader consequences than commonly thought, as we live in the era of information Saracevic, 1995. Due to the inability of some systems to ensure their safety and reliability, the evaluation immediately showed its importance for the early information research systems Saracevic, 1995. Then, under the influence of evaluation information, the information research systems were developed to better suit the users needs Saracevic, 1995. Moreover, the standards regarding the level of reliability of particular sources of information and their relevance have been developed due to the increase of the information flow Information literacy  IEM , 2021. Nowadays, IR systems have proved their functionality and tremendous capacity to help researchers find the necessary information  and this has happened because the evaluation processes were appropriately used, aiming at positive changes.
The variety of opportunities to implement evaluation to reach particular goals is almost unlimited because every humanrelated process can be standardized and classified. For example, evaluation can be used in higher education to calculate and compare the effectiveness of different types of testing of the students knowledge Jonson et al., 2014. Despite the sphere of use, evaluation has experienced drastic changes during its development and has been reconceptualized and challenged to better understand its effects Cummings, 2002. Thus, with the use of the integrated theory of influence, evaluation processes are one of the primary sources of information for decisionmaking.
Conclusion
Overall, the integrated theory of influence portrays the system of evaluation disregarding the sphere of its implementation, the number of people involved, and the special conditions of the situation. This theory reflects the interconnection of the possible effects of evaluation processes in general and the utilization of the information gathered as a result of the evaluation process. The number of opportunities to affect the object of evaluation, employees of the company, citizens of the state, or any other group, subject, or process intentionally or unintentionally reveals the functionality of the evaluation process. Therefore, evaluation information can be helpful in many business cases for developing solutions to problems at the governmental level or just assessing the students level of competence in a subject.",0.0
e_vjd8z5xe,4,"In the future, I believe that driverless cars will be a great invention. Driverless cars can help people when they are tired or even drunk. The car can also tell you if something is wrong with it or if you need to take over. They may not always work as planned but in some cases i think that this would save lives and make life easier. These new cars could have many benefits such as saving gas, making driving more fun, and being safer than regular cars.

The first reason why these cars should be made is because they could use less gas then normal cars do. In paragraph 2, it states ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" Since Google's self driven cars have been out for so long, their mileage must be very good. The way technology works nowadays, its bound to get better too. With all of the advances we make in science today, our gas consumption rate will eventually decrease.

Another benefit from these cars is that they might make driving more enjoyable. Paragraph 7 says that ""the incar entertainment system would include headsup displays"" which means that while you sit back and relax, your car drives itself! This would allow drivers to watch movies or play games on screens that appear whenever there is danger ahead. Although these options could cause accidents, most people can handle themselves and know how to stay safe without getting distracted by an accident waiting to happen.

Lastly, these cars could be much safer than todays vehicles. Even though they aren't completely independent yet, they still can prevent lots of crashes. In paragraph 6, it states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". This statement proves that the driver doesn't necessarily need to pay attention to the road at all times. Most cars require your full attention no matter what condition the roads are in. When your phone rings, you text someone or you simply get bored of driving, your mind starts wandering off. This leads to distractions causing you to lose focus and possibly even fall asleep behind the wheel. All of those problems wouldn't exist anymore because you don't even have to touch the steering wheel or anything else inside the vehicle until there is an emergency situation where only humans can control things.

Overall, I believe that these cars are a great idea. If it isn't finished yet, it definitely will be soon enough. Driving shouldn't be dangerous and we should start putting in efforts to fix that problem. It's about time we put our brains to good use.",0.9
e_n3kdtrfv,-2,"Labor lawyer James Hoffa, refusing to concede defeat in the Teamsters union presidential election nearly a week after his opponent claimed victory, called Thursday for a congressional investigation into the vote.
Hoffa on Tuesday formally asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to impound the ballots and initiate an FBI investigation into ""serious irregularities"" in the election.
""We really have what I call Teamstergate,"" Hoffa told reporters at a news conference Thursday at the Teamsters' Detroit offices, where his legendary father, the late Jimmy Hoffa, ruled the union in the 1950s and '60s.
Incumbent Teamsters President Ron Carey on Saturday claimed victory in the hardfought election, winning by an apparent margin of about 17,000 votes. But 41,002 ballots were set aside for further eligibility checks, and Hoffa says more than 25,000 other ballots may have disappeared.
After all eligible votes were tallied late Saturday, courtappointed Election Officer Barbara Zack Quindel accounted for 485,605 mailin ballots returned. But last week she reported that the total number of ballots received was 511,268, an estimate based on receipts from the U.S. Postal Service.
Hoffa said he wants an explanation for the discrepancy between the ballots counted and the ballots received.
""If I lost, I lost. I just want a fair election,"" Hoffa said.
Carey, 60, was first elected president of the 1.4 millionmember International Brotherhood of Teamsters as a reformer in 1991. His apparent reelection was lauded by AFLCIO President John Sweeney, who had remained neutral during the campaign.
Meanwhile, Quindel decided Wednesday to void 120 Hoffa votes after finding that a Hoffa backer and former officer of Teamsters Local 743 in Chicago violated election rules by collecting and mailing ballots for other members, according to her spokesman, Jeff O'Mara.
Acting on a protest filed by Carey's campaign last week, O'Mara said Quindel decided it would be too extreme a remedy to void all of the local's ballots.
The ballots from Local 743 were among the 41,002 ballots that were being checked for eligibility.
The election officer has not disclosed interim results of the tabulation of those ballots and O'Mara said he did not know when the final tally would be completed.
But Hoffa said Thursday that initial tabulations of the socalled challenged ballots have cut Carey's lead by as much as 2,400 votes.
The Carey campaign, however, said the lead was cut only by about 1,500 votes. The latest count which included the strongly proHoffa Local 743, showed Carey with 230,111 and Hoffa with 214,906 with about 30,000 of the challenged ballots remaining to be processed and counted if found to be eligible, the Carey campaign said.",0.0
e_pr4vycry,4,"My position on driverless cars is, that they won't be as safe as cars driven by humans. I believe this because they wouldn't know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldn't be very supportive during deflect stations.

First I believe they wouldn't know when to stop because they might be road block and they wouldn't be able to identify the objects. Examples from the passage are, the cars will probably have a hard time navigating through work zones and around accidents. The cars will also have to deal with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadworks or roadblocks that lie ahead for the autonomous car.

Second reason is, they might go out of control. The car might face some technical deities and someone will most likely get injured. If some dies get injured who will be at fault? Wil it is the driver or the manufacturer. I believe it will be the manufacturer because they made the car and they didn't make sure if it was safe for the people to drive around in or not.

My last reason is They wouldn't be as supportive during deflect stations. I think They wouldn't be very supportive because the car might not know what to do. For example, if there was roadblock and the car didn't or couldn't indemnify them and the car crushes. What if the car was told to go somewhere and went to wrong way? Will it be the cars fault. And if the car got broken down for no reason during traffic will it be okay for other people.

In conclusion i belief that driverless cars won't be as safe as cars driven by humans. I believe this because they wouldn't know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldn't be very supportive during deflect stations.",0.0
e_73n6jkul,-2,"Meredith Corp CEO, William T. Kerr, has announced plans to acquire more television stations in 1997 due to a decline in prices. While this move may surprise some, Kerr believes that it is an opportune time for his company to expand its reach.
In recent years, the cost of owning and operating television stations has been on the rise. However, Kerr's team has noted a decrease in prices over the past few months. With this in mind, Kerr plans to take advantage of the current market conditions to acquire new television stations that will help expand the company's profile.
Meredith Corp is a leading media and marketing company that specializes in publishing, broadcasting, and marketing services for various industries. The company currently owns and operates 17 television stations across the country, including CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox affiliates.
Kerr believes that the acquisition of more stations will give Meredith Corp a stronger presence in the broadcasting industry. He is confident that the company can successfully navigate the challenges that come with owning and operating television stations, and believes this move will be beneficial for both the company and its clients.
""Our goal is to find television stations that complement our existing portfolio and give us an even stronger platform for providing our advertising and marketing services to clients,"" Kerr said in a recent statement. ""We are excited about the opportunity to expand our reach and build on our success to date.""
While the exact number of stations Meredith Corp plans to acquire has not been disclosed, industry analysts predict that the company will likely pursue deals that are around 100 million or less. This is a significant decrease from typical acquisition prices in the past.
In addition to its television station acquisitions, Kerr is also exploring other ways to expand Meredith Corp's reach in the media industry. This includes partnerships with other media companies and increasing the company's digital presence.
Despite some uncertainty in the industry due to the rise of streaming services and changes in consumer viewing habits, Kerr remains optimistic about the future of television broadcasting and Meredith Corp's ability to weather any potential storms.
""We believe there is still a significant opportunity for growth in the television industry, and we are committed to staying at the forefront of these changes,"" he said. ""With our long history of success and our talented team, we are confident that we can continue to lead the way in providing highquality content and advertising opportunities for our clients.""
As the year progresses, it will be interesting to see how Meredith Corp's acquisition plans unfold and how they will impact the company's overall strategy. For now, Kerr and his team are focused on positioning the company for longterm success in the everchanging media landscape.",1.0
e_dt6u3iuu,-1,"Dear Principal,

I think that we should be able to use our cellphones during lunch and free periods. I don't really see why not, it wouldn't take away from the work you are trying to accomplish as a principal or a student. It would just help us out by letting us have fun with our friends while still learning in class. Lunch is one of my favorite parts about school so if i can talk on the phone with my family then thats all i could ask for!

If students were allowed to bring their phones to school they might even try harder in their classes because they know they get to text everyone else after. The kids might even listen more than before when teachers start talking about whats going on in the classroom because they are excited to use them later on.

This policy will also give kids an incentive to do good things like: turn in homework, complete assignments, finish tests early, etc... If there was something this good waiting for them at the end of each day then they would actually want to do well in their classes instead of always having to remind them every time. Plus they won't be using them during class so there wont be any problems at all!

In conclusion, I believe that we shouldn't ban cellphones completely but let them be used only in certain situations such as lunch and other break times. This way noones gonna feel left out either and everyone can join in. In today's society people need cellphones because without them how are you supposed to find your parents? We can't walk everywhere anymore, theres too many cars! So its important that you allow the use of these devices. Thank you very much for reading my letter and I hope that you agree with me and change the schools current policy on cellphone usage.",0.9
e_czq80tyy,0,"I think the limiting for car usage is not right because if people want to drive they should be able to. Walking, and riding bicycles aren't fun you get tired really easy and have to stop but when you are in a car you don't get tired and you don't have to stop you just keep driving.

Driving a car is easier because when you are late for work or getting somewhere you can get there faster. If you are walking or riding a bike your not going to get there on time a car is faster and quicker to get to places without any trouble. Gas could be high but it is worth it because a lady with three kids could be rushing trying not to be late for work and trying to get her kids ready for school so instead of walking them to school or riding bikes she could just drive them to school and not be late for work. Driving a car is so much easier and quicker.

Traffic with cars is bad but when you need to get places you can drive a car instead of taking the bus that has to stop ten different places. Cars are being banned in Columbia and you can only ridebuses ortaxis. Taxis can get you where you need to just as fast as your own car can but a bus couldn't because there is always people in front of you that have to get off in different places. They made two seated bikes just for this man and his wife to get around because they didn't want them driving there cars.

Teenagers get there license at a young age now and they start driving. They drive to school and to practices and everywhere else but it could be dangerous because some teenagers just like to goof and round and try to act all bad and then end up hurting them self and somebody else and it would be their fault. Some teens just decide not to get them because it is safe just to ride with their parents instead of them driving and having the chance to get in a wreck and hurt their self and then there car be ruined and won't be able to get a new one. Most teens love to drive because it's fun and they like getting out on there own. Teens like to go out and hang with there friends or go get something to eat. Other people are more worried about there job and social life then trying to get a car so they can drive all the time.

In conclusion, a limiting on car usage should be that they shouldn't have a limiting on car usage because most people are late for stuff when they don't drive there car. Walking and driving a car is way different a car is way faster then walking and trying to get to places on time. That is my opinion on limiting to car usage.",0.0
e_mqlbf4px,-6,As the cold blade glinted ominously in the dimly lit alley my heart raced with fear. Time seemed to slow as panic threatened to consume me. Yet instead of surrendering to terror an audacious thought pierced through. Sliding my trembling hand into my pocket I withdrew a worn pack of cards. The person of eyes comes in confusion momentarily distracted by my unexpected response. Seizing the opportune moment I flicked my wrist causing the cards to burst into a mesmerizing flurry. Astonishment momentarily froze the assailant s movements allowing me to escape the jaws of peril and leave behind a bewildered thief forever holding a knife that would never strike.,0.95
e_rf9h4z2q,4,"The driverless car could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing. It can lead to many problems such as accidents, malfunctioning, and more. The driverless car is not something we should be pushing for in the near future because of all these reasons listed above.

The main reason why I think this would be a bad idea is because what happens when there are some mechanical issues with the vehicle? If someone has their foot on the breaker, but the car doesn't stop then who gets blamed for that? There will be an argument about whether or not the owner was really paying attention. Also if the person were asleep while the car was driving them somewhere then they wouldn't have any way of knowing how to take over the controls in case something goes wrong. In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming,"" paragraph 9 states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" This proves my point exactly. The owner shouldn't have to get into trouble just because he bought a new gadget. Not everyone is able to afford these things and even if they did buy one, there's no guarentee it won't mess up from time to time.

Another big issue here is safety. If you are sleeping behind the wheel and your car needs help navigating through traffic or around work zones, then how do you know to wake up and take control? You don't. The owner isn't always going to be alert enough to drive by themselves which means more accidents. And accidents mean injuries which means people getting hurt. But maybe it'll be the other way around where the computer system crashes, stops working, or starts glitching out. Who knows what might happen. In the same passage mentioned earlier, paragraph 8 says ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" That being said, they should stick with this rule instead of trying to make changes.

I believe these changes should remain unchanged until further notice because of all the possible ways it can go awry. Malfunctions and lack of alertness from owners are the two biggest threats to society right now, so anything like driverless cars should stay away. They aren't worth the money or risk involved with it. Let us keep our lives intact without having to worry about losing everything due to a mistake made by either the machine itself or someone else not watching their surroundings carefully. Driverless cars should stay drivered at all costs.",0.9

Although I disagree with them they provide some great information on the planet but in general I still believe they don't think it's a good idea. The author has very good research in their article. They give us knowledge about the planets and the dangers that might happen with them going to Venus.

In the article the author provides many facts that back up their claim of why it's worth going to Venus despite this being a dangerous place to go and studying. They also give facts on how they can be able to travel there safely if they choose to. If they go to Mars or Venus they will know what planets are like. The author will also inform readers on what they have to say about Venus. It will give readers information about how Venus looks and is just like the rest of our universe and how it is compared to earth. Overall this article was great and did have some good points that really supported why I think its important and helpful to go to Venus. I know there are many reasons on why this is good and helpful. I can agree they have great research and research, but it's all the evidence they provided and not just the ones that is helpful to make the article better.

The author stated that ""Nothing is impossible on Venus, and if there is a way to get to it, I would suggest that scientists float above the fray..."" and that NASA has been thinking of many ideas but not yet. They also gave the reader insight on the conditions of Venus. This leads them to know tha going to Venus is not something we should not take lightly.

Although the author's claim still has alot of things wrong with it but they are able to come up with ideas that can help you with your own idea on the topic.

Throughout this article they have some great evidence on why it should be studied. They provide evidence and research that will help you come to a conclusion. This article explains more than anything they could do to make it better and makes it clear that he doesn't think about the dangers of going to Venus but just for the information that it would provide to them.

When they vote for a president they are actually voting fro their state. If they were to not vote then they would have to be very careful in their voting. Some of the electors don't even really know who will be in charge of it.

Why do they do that? Well it all depends on the states the electors chose and there votes to be counted. Whoever thinks it was all up to the House of Representatives and thats what they were all about to do. This is why electoral votes are so important and what do you think is wrong.

e_b6875hsv,2,"Do you think that the face on mars is a natural landform or created by aliens? I think it was created by aliens. The reason i say this is because there are some things in life we know and other things where we don't know. We don't know about space, but we do know about our land formations here on earth. This land formation looks like a human head formed from shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Some people believe the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars. They said they have taken pictures of the face using a camera 3 times sharper than the original Viking photos. When you see a picture of it you would just assume its another one of those "" Martian mesa"" which are landforms common around Cydonia area on Mars. There are also defenders of NASA who say the face is bona fide evidence of life on Marshas been hidden by haze or clouds. Maybe it could be created by aliens but most likely not. You can find many faces of different land forms all over Earth. It would seem to me that if they were going to make it look like a real person then why does it not have arms legs or anything else besides a head. Why didnt these so called aliens give them more body parts. If someone really made it out of something then why does it not look realistic. Wouldn't they want it to look realistic?

e_qhc0r5a9,6,"The author of the artical "" The challenge of Exploaring Venus"" supports that idea of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers. Venus has been called earth's twin, but there are many diffrent things about it compared to Earth. Although many people may think that going into space and exploring other planets is very dangerous and difficult , I beleive the author did an excellent job in supporting his claim of why we should go study Venus even if it comes with risks.

In the article they give us several reasons as to why we should go explore Venus and some of these include :Venus being one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, how it can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, how NASA has one particualrly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and lastly because it would benefit our understanding of the planet itself which also happens to be a worthy pursuit.

My first reason from this list is that Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth's 'twin'. The text states,""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". This statement means that venus could have once had oceans just like Earth does today. It says that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. These similarities between the two planets make them seem almost alike.

Another reason is that Venus is the second plantet away from us on our solar system. In paragraph 2 it states,'A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.'. Even though Venus has these conditions it is still worth the risk to see what kind of formations it has or what kind of things we will find out there.

NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to studdying Venus. They want to float above the fray. In paragragh 3 it explains how scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Another way that NASA wants to solve the problem would be to use mechanical computers made of gears and levers .

Lastly, studying Venus would help benefit our understanding of the planet itself which is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph 8 it states,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."".

I believe that all of my reasons support the authors claim of why we should pursue going and visiting Venus and taking time to look at everything and take samples and collect data about Venus. We might never know what we could learn from something so far away unless we take the chance and try to figure out what we have yet to discover. If you ask me, I say lets do it! Why put off something important? Just because we don't have any proof of anything doesn't mean it isn't true.",0.9

It s our first way of doing things in America. The electoral college is not about electors. The electorial college is made up of electors and all of that. The electorial college can also be hard on us sometimes. When you are running to become a president you can only win if you get enough votes.

e_dhtul5qk,2,"Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on it. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This phenomenon was later called The Face on Mars. 
But scientists figure it just as another martian mesa. Common around Cydonia region with unusal shadows, that look likes a human head. They thought would be an great idea for publicity to grab people's attention toward Mars missions by presenting The Face on Mars.
It was great publicity! It became a huge icon of Mars. Appeared in many films and magazines as a evidence of extraterrestrial life existence in Mars. Many people started believing in it, that the The Face on Mars was not just a natural landforms, it was an actual artifacts made by extraterrestrial life. And they were trying to cover it up, say conspiracy theories. Even people wished this was an actual thing as the NASA had a really low fundings to do Mars missions. And the tax payers are not happy about it.
Finally after eighteen long years the Viking mission ended, Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft arrive to Mars on September of 1979. NASA's priority were to map whole planet and they photographed Cydonia region again and they called the photographer Michael Malin's team and take much better pictures.
So on 5th of April 1978 Michael Malin took the photos with ten times sharper image than before. Then upload the photos online for public and everyone was really shocked! It looked nothing similar like before with just rocks and shadows. No more extraterrestrial monuments after all.
Some of the conspiracy theory believers were disappointed with this. They argued the new image had some flaws and hazy clouds over face on it so the image didn't look clear. They still believed the alien face behind haze. But the scientists explained the Mars Global Surveyor normally looks at down to scan it like fax machine in stripes but in April '98 when it was taking the photo there were wispy cloud over Cydonia. 
So the conspiracy theorists asked NASA take another photo again in clear weather. They had to fly over Face on Mars with the help of other satellites. The scientist were agreed with the request and they explained to general public, that the face on Mars are in 41 degrees North martian latitude it was winter in April '98 there and its a quite a cloudy time there, as there was not many chance for space craft pass over there it is not an easy thing to capture good photo of that region as their priority is scanning the mars with stripes with a 2.5 kilometer of each other. But as their was high request to do so the Mars Global Surveyor took photo once again but nothing much clear to explain the theory about extraterrestrial. So that ended all those theories and myth around The Face on Mars was just another natural landforms after all, there wasn't any monument made by ancient alien in Mars.

e_bcma70hh,3,"When I was younger, I used to love listening to my grandpa's stories about his time spent working on a ranch in Montana. He would tell me about the vast open spaces, the icy cold winters, and the neverending workdays. I was fascinated by the life of a cowboy and the adventures he must have had.

Now, I have the chance to experience those adventures for myself. I am a participant in the Seagoing Cowboys program, and I couldn't be more thrilled. This program has allowed me to visit some of the most amazing places on earth. I've explored the glaciers of Alaska, the coral reefs of the Caribbean, and the ancient ruins of Greece.

The experiences I've had in this program have been lifechanging. I've learned about new cultures, made new friends, and seen sights that I never would have imagined. I would highly recommend the Seagoing Cowboys program to anyone looking for an adventure.

So if you're looking for an adventure, or if you're just looking to get away from the ordinary, I urge you to sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. You won't regret it.",1.0
e_2tagzcbc,-7,"dear principle i think that students should be required to do community service for three reasons. the first being it will keep them busy it will teach them the benefits of hard work and it will get them off the streets and have them doing something positive. the community service will keep kids busy because they need to be doing something constructive in their spare time instead of partying watching television and playing violent video games. also the community service will help them the benefits of hard work. it will show that can help them have a perspective and by doing the smallest things, you can get better. and last but not least it will get them off the streets and have them doing something positive because if kids are at home and doing nothing they are likely to experiment with bad behavior. this can lead to them being with there parents and sometimes getting thrown in jail. we could stop this from happening if we get all kids to do some form of community service.",0.05
e_o661ovby,-1,"There are innumerable extracurricular opportunities for students to participate in at their school. Most schools offer a broad range of activities, which is why I agree that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at their school. No matter what the activity is, it can be good for the mind and the body. Therefore, students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will give the students a chance to try things that they normally wouldn't, it will provide students with more opportunities to make friends, and it will better serve them in the long run.

Requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will give them a chanceto try things that they normally would not. Most people tend to stay in their comfort zone, but this rule will challenge them to try new things that they will hopefully enjoy. For example, someone that neverreads might never join their school's book club, but with this rule they could join the book club and discover that they love reading. Overall, trying new things is essential to finding new interests.

This rule would also be very beneficial to the students because it would provide them with more opportunities to make friends. Some students have a hard time talking to new people, so this rule would require them to join a team or club and talk to the people also on that team or in that club. This would be great for both the students joining the extracurricular activity, and the people already participating in the activity. Lastly, all of the students involved would have an equal opportunity to meet new people and become friends.

Finally, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good rule because it will better serve them in the long run. Extracurricular activities can teach the students new skills that can become very useful to them in the future. Colleges also take extracurricularactivities into account when they are reviewing applications. The most outlandish skills can become useful at any time, so it is important for students to learn about whatever interests them, because they never know when they will need those skills. To conclude, participating in at least one extracurricular activity will be more helpful to students in the future.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will give them an opportunity to try new things, make new friends, and it will be better for them in the future. If schools had this rule, then more students would enjoy going to school, and they would become more involved in the school. Once people are out of their comfort zone, then they will discover new interests that they never knew they had. Overall, this rule would help many students come out of their comfort zones and become more confident people.",0.0

NASA is trying to make rocket ships and machines that could withstand the pressure and heat. NASA have came up with good idea of a rocket ship that uses the same techonolgy that was use in world war 2.

Sensors that could survive the pressure and heat would come in handy. It would be really cool to be the person that made the technology to land on the face of the face of Venus. It would be a great experience to be the first person to go on the face of Venus and see the face face of the planet. Nasa is trying to come up with a machine that could withstand the pressure and heat for a long time. The author had said that the author has not been to Venus. What he had done was research about it and had come up with good ideas on how to land on the face of the planet.

Nasa is trying to make more technology that are more resistant to the pressure and heat. In the article the author said that Venus is covered in a thick layer of carbon dioxide.

e_9jw4d5qc,-3,"I feel that having more time in school is good but in my opinion i think theres some bad and good reasons why its good and bad because thats when you can be with the teacher more. 

 First some students have to go visit a church and get to know what they are learning about or maybe they just dont have the time because they work after school. Second if you go with your teacher and he or she could explain the work that your doing in the class and then after class your going to have homework and test and you will have time to do any of that for the test or test you might not be able to remember your notes that day and remember what you learned in class. The other con of having to stay longer than the seven days you could be working more because your not really focusing in your work so its hard to get things done when your at home doing all of those thing. Third pro is having one hour less of school per week is really hard because sometimes its just to much for everyone in general and it may just make it even harder but it could give you motivation to learn more stuff and what your learning and not forget. And the most important thing the teachers and the students might talk about and talk to you and answer any question or just listen to them, then you won't be there or ask for help on something or get some help with one thing that you have no idea about. I know that some teachers would give out the same thing but some times it can get confusing to some people and some of them are gonna be late to turn in work but its not that much of an issue. You can make up your own mind about it but that depends on how you want to take your class or other classwork because you know more things about that class but at the end of of the day you just have 10 minutes more to finish. If you get extra time from school they can do whatever they like for homework or studying. It could also effect you by just not getting that many work done in one day. Some teachers can also tell you why you are having trouble on doing stuff like going home, doing homework, playing sports, and going shopping or even doing chores for school and doing work for your friends or going somewhere else with family or friends that arent as good because some kids do things on there own and that is just boring but for other people who just come to school everyday they will just say that they dont like school but the people that come from other place will argue and say its bad for them.They are the type of person who does not get stuff done and end up doing other stuff not doing their work or their having fun with their friends but when they get home they always ask about something that there going on with them and they say ""you got to come back the next school"" so they could say something nice about them or something they told them what happend they had to tell the other students of their day about how there day was or why they left the school board. They can go and hang out with there friends andor just stay home and watch videos or go out and play games but also go see their favorite players and do fun thing and see who their really good at and how they love playing games and watching movies or doing video games or any other things that can really help them become better people or being nice to each other.

The reason I disagree is that there going to be better cars than what they are now they're just going to keep coming out with new stuff and everything. In the future like 2032 type stuff like that i really don't know because i don't even know if I'm still going to be living at that time. Yeah, they're coming out with new cars yes people are still going to be driving even if the car is old or new you're still going to do something.

I mean none is going to walk I know I'm not, but some people might have to of take the bus because they don't have a car or some like that BTU other than people is still going to drive and so will I Then again i really don't know if I'm still going to be here to see it but I still say no people love driving I do I mean I really be angry if school take away cars like people will be mad and complain because that's how they get to places that's how I get to places.

And if u don't have a car you can take a bus our a tax, but a tax is considered a car to so a train fly and airplane. My final answer is disagreed because that's not going to happened my prediction to the world when it becomes the future if I live to see it. Really the point of this article is would cars still be in the future the article is saying no not but I really believe yes it would be but to be honest we really would know until we have actually seen it for ourselves but I mean if they have gone take cars away in the that mean they should have been taken it these years ago like they would ask use thing in 2012 but its 2016 and cars are still here and going to stay here not that long like 2045 type stuff if I live to see that year I would be 45.

e_x91l96oj,4,"Driverless cars are coming, and with them, a whole new set of pros and cons. In the article, the author discusses both the benefits and the risks of driverless cars. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks.

There are several reasons that I believe driverless cars are a good idea. First, they could dramatically reduce the number of traffic accidents. In the United States alone, there are more than 30,000 traffic fatalities every year.1 Driverless cars could potentially reduce this number by eliminating human error. Second, they could reduce traffic congestion. In large cities, driverless cars could be routed to the most efficient path, eliminating the need for people to sit in traffic jams. Third, they could reduce pollution. Driverless cars would be able to run on electric power, which would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere.

There are also a few potential risks associated with driverless cars. First, they could potentially be hacked, which could lead to accidents or even terrorist attacks. Second, they could be subject to software malfunctions, which could result in accidents. Third, they could be more expensive than traditional cars, which could limit their accessibility.

Despite these risks, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. They could reduce traffic fatalities, traffic congestion, and pollution. They are also likely to be more affordable in the long run than traditional cars. I think it is important to explore the potential benefits of driverless cars and work to mitigate the risks associated with them.",1.0
e_ef7bcumd,-2,"Introduction:
The role of media in shaping public opinion and influencing international affairs cannot be underestimated. In this context, Russia Today RT, a statefunded news outlet, has gained considerable attention due to its coverage of events related to Ukraine. This essay aims to analyze the position and practices of Russia Today in light of the Hutchins Report on a free and responsible press. By examining RT's coverage of news about Ukraine, we can assess the extent to which the outlet adheres to the principles recommended by the Hutchins Report.
Body:
1. Understanding the Hutchins Report:
The Hutchins Report, released in 1947, delineates the essential principles of a free and responsible press. These principles include truthfulness, accuracy, fairness, and independence. By analyzing RT's coverage of Ukraine, we can evaluate whether it aligns with these foundational principles.
2. RT's Position and Perspective:
Russia Today holds a distinct position in the media landscape as an outlet funded by Russian state authorities. As such, it tends to reflect the official Russian perspective on international affairs. This bias presents a challenge when assessing the outlet's commitment to independence and objectivity, as outlined in the Hutchins Report.
3. Truthfulness and Accuracy:
The Hutchins Report emphasizes the importance of truthfulness and accuracy in news coverage. RT's coverage of Ukraine's crisis has faced scrutiny in these areas. While some reports may contain accurate information, critics argue that the outlet selectively presents information to advance a specific narrative. This selective reporting raises questions about the outlet's compliance with the Hutchins Report's principles.
4. Fairness and Multiple Perspectives:
The Hutchins Report emphasizes the necessity of presenting multiple perspectives to ensure fairness in news coverage. When analyzing RT's coverage of Ukraine, it becomes evident that the outlet tends to amplify the Russian narrative while often neglecting opposing viewpoints. This approach skews the perception of events, hindering the audience's ability to form an objective opinion.
5. Propaganda and Manipulation:
The Hutchins Report explicitly condemns the use of propaganda by the media. Critics argue that RT's coverage of Ukraine tends to include elements of propaganda, disseminating biased information to strengthen Russia's position. By promoting a onesided narrative, RT's practices deviate from the ethical guidelines outlined in the Hutchins Report.
6. Ethical Responsibility of News Outlets:
The Hutchins Report emphasizes the ethical responsibility of news outlets towards society. A responsible press should strive to provide unbiased, factual information to inform the public. RT's coverage of Ukraine, often marred by propaganda and selective reporting, raises concerns about the outlet's adherence to the principles of ethical responsibility.
Conclusion:
Analyzing Russia Today's coverage of news about Ukraine in light of the Hutchins Report reveals several areas of concern. While the outlet may occasionally provide accurate information, its selective reporting, promotion of a onesided narrative, and occasional use of propaganda weaken its claim of being a responsible press. Recognizing the importance of a free and responsible press that upholds the principles outlined in the Hutchins Report is essential to fostering an informed and objective public opinion.",1.0

e_hmxp62i0,-1,"Parents always want to make the best decisions for their kids, whether it is homeschooling them or enrolling them into an actual school. Many students would rather be enrolled into a school than to be sitting at home all day video calling a teacher. Attending classes at home would not benefit students because they would lack social skills, less help, along withnot fulfilling certain academic skills.

One of the biggest parts of taking classes at school are meeting new people and making connections with people. Bonding with friends and teachers can make a big impact on a students life, and not having the ability to do that can make a difference. Without social skills even the smallest tasks, like asking for help or greeting someone, could be nerve rackingor difficult. During school I have needed to ask teachers or friends so many questions, because I did not understand the unit. The ability for me to ask peers and adults for help is a great gift that I greatly appreciate in my life. Social skills have helped me in so many situations that I could not have done myself if I were to take classes from home.

Attending classes from home may be less stressful on students because of less distractions and less people, but there is very little to no extra help. Taking classes at home is only the student and the teacher on a singular call. There are not nearly enough sources to obtain help from when taking classes at home. Whenever I am in need of help I would ask my friends or ask the teacher and they would give me an abundance amount of sources for help on whatever I am struggling on. When home schooled it is different and there is limited amount of help provided. Everyone deserves the help they desire for classes and that is a benefit of kids going to school for learning instead of home.

Taking part in school is an experience that everyone should go though and grow from. School develops so many academic skill sets that students learning from home would never have. Not having these academic skills could hurt the students learning from home. In schools they all have certain rules to follow with how to learn and act around others. At home they may be completely different. Once they enter the world outside their house it may be hard on the students because it is entirely different. When I had advanced from middle school to high school I thought it was a hard enough transition. I cannot imagine going from home schooledinto the real world. The academic skills at schools need to be brought upon the students learning at home so they can understand what everyone else does.

The benefits students would have learning at school over at home is not even a question. Schools provide so much in many more ways than home. Schools provide students with better social skills, academic skills, and more help towards students who are in need of it. Home schooling students may not be a bad decision for some kids, because of certain situations, like disabilities and mental health, but most schools have programs and certain teachers who are more than willing to help those students learn and expand more. Overall learning and taking classes in school is a much better decision than at home.",0.0
e_fhwxuh0o,-1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, my piers and I have heard about what you are trying to do to our students, i highly disagree with you forcing us to do community service, i hope you take the time to read some of these suggestions.

Most students would consider community service a punishment, a very brutal punishment. You cant require students to do community service for no reason, although for a punishment for something a student has done wrong i highly agree, depending on the strength of the crime. Although your asking for all students to perform community service routinely, my main issue with your idea is that if you did make us do this, it would have to be outside of school hours, or cutting major time into our lunchrecess.

If possible, you could cut 5 minutes into each class, that would acquire 30 minutes for community service, depending on the schedule each group of students can do a different job, such as cleaning the cafeteria, hallways, courtyard and emptying the garbagerecycling bins. The concern is that you want us students to take time out of our day, when we did nothing wrong, as stated in the this paragraph you can take time out of classes, but its almost a guarantee that you wouldn't even 2nd guess that, and the students opinion.

I want you to think about how you would feel after a long day of school, 6 hours of straight learning with no breaks or free time, having to spend an hour along the highway cleaning up road kill and fast food rappers all across the ground, in the hot sun. Reading and teaching elementary school children shouldn't even be thought of, why would we drive all the way to their school in our free time to help 6th graders with their math when they can hire a tutor, or stay after class and get some extra help, sure if they are willing to come to us during school hours, otherwise i highly doubt that anyone will do your amazing plan of community service.

If a student is caught smoking illegal substances, or perhaps vandalizing, fighting, bullyingharassment, then sure, go for it, but your trying to force innocent well behaved students into doing your dirty work, cleaning up random trash across the hallways when its the custodians job. Depending on the crime entitled i think the punishment should vary, physical fighting, 2 hours of community service, smoking illegal substances, 5 hours of community service, vandalizing, 7 hours of community service, and bullying 1 hour of community service.

Why should you listen to a 14 year old telling you how to do your job? Maybe because he's speaking for the whole school, and all of us don't think its fair that you would just consider this without consulting any of us, taking a vote, or even trying to reason, i hope you get time to read this, and at least consider some changes in your plan.",0.0

e_k6dtyeab,0,"Title: The Advantageous Path of Limiting Car Usage

In conclusion, limiting car usage through the promotion of alternatives like public transit, biking, and walking provides many advantages. It can help alleviate issues such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and climate change while also improving public health and wellbeing. Citizens should consider reducing their personal car trips where possible to make cities more sustainable for themselves and future communities. Overall, limiting car usage has significant environmental and social benefits that can positively impact both current and future generations.

By eliminating the usage of personal cars you will be saving our ecosystem. According to source 1 ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" In certain parts of the United States gas emissions from personal cars make up half of all the polution going into the green house effect. If you just take a city bus or train you are not only saving the worlds atmosphere but you are also saving you pockets.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. After the ban, congestion was reduced by 60 percent, and the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Similarly, Bogota implemented a carfree day, which resulted in streets devoid of traffic jams and a decrease in smog. These examples show that reducing car usage can have a positive impact on air pollution and public health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage about Vauban, Germany, explains that the community is completely carfree, except for a few main streets with access to public transportation. As a result, residents rely on cycling and walking as their primary modes of transportation. This not only reduces car dependency but also encourages physical activity, leading to a healthier population.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the benefits it has on urban planning and design. In Vauban, the prohibition of cars has led to a more compact and accessible community. The district's design emphasizes ""smart planning,"" with amenities and public transportation within walking distance. This approach allows for a more efficient use of space and promotes a sense of community and connection among residents. By adopting similar designs in our own community, we can create a more livable and sustainable environment.

Lastly, the shift from car culture is also identified in the United States. Recent studies reveal that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less Rosenthal, Passage 4. One outcome is the beneficial impact on carbon emissions and the environment, which is a positive move towards mitigating climate change Rosenthal, Passage 4. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage has various advantages that contribute to a more sustainable and livable environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating compact and accessible suburbs, improving air quality, and promoting alternatives to personal vehicles, communities can move towards a more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and support initiatives that encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.",0.875
e_1smgcm7i,0,"As a student in grade 10, I have come to understand the importance of limiting car usage. Cars are a vital part of our lives, but using them excessively can have negative impacts on the environment and our health. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage and why it is important for us to do so.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. According to the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide each year. By reducing car usage, we can decrease the amount of harmful gases released into the air, which will improve air quality and reduce the number of premature deaths.

Secondly, limiting car usage can also help reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a common problem in cities, and it can cause delays, frustration, and even accidents. By using public transportation, cycling, or walking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, which will help alleviate traffic congestion.

Thirdly, limiting car usage can also save us money. Cars are expensive to maintain and operate, and the cost of fuel, insurance, and repairs can add up quickly. By using alternative modes of transportation, we can save money on gas, parking, and other expenses associated with car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce air pollution, alleviate traffic congestion, and save us money. As responsible citizens, we should do our part to reduce car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation. By doing so, we can create a healthier and more sustainable environment for ourselves and future generations.",1.0

Truth was that he truly enjoyed his job and the sense of accomplishment he received from helping his small community by getting people that he knew were truly guilty of their crime off the street. Over the years he had become become a of the law and and he he had the uncommon the members of the department and even even the mayor.

Although murders weren t unheard of by any means this case was so horrendous that even the FBI had come to town to help handle the investigation. The crime had been on the news for several days prior to them finally tracking down their only suspect and the whole town was still in shock from what few details had leaked out. Word around town was there were so many body parts that the officers hadn t been able to determine the number of victims and it had been nearly a week! One thing the detectives and FBI officers working the case did know was that the victims hadn t come from this town. In fact they couldn t find where the victims had come from at all. Preliminary DNA results weren t providing any leads and the detectives had nothing to go on other than a vague description given by a well known homeless drunkard of a tall man in a dark coat. The drunkard had told officers that he saw the man leaving the park where the bodies had been found and walking towards a local motel. The officers had went directly to the motel where they found the strange man and brought him into the station without incident. Even though the FBI companies leading the investigation had was aware of Lukess conviction record and agreed that he should be the one to support this issue and to the only suspect they had to. So Paul began his interview process the same as he always did just like he had done for the training videos by being very friendly to the man and offering him food drinks cigarettes etc. The man politely declined all of Paul s offerings and continued to sit there across the table with the same blank expression on his face he had when the officers initially arrested him. None of this phased Paul as he knew he would have the answers to all of his questions in no time. Considering his audience he decided to cut straight to it Paul hit him with the key phrase that he had become famous for. You know know why you have this right?? you you you you tell me you t you? Paul had asked this question countless times of guilty men who usually responded with something like no I have no idea and their minds would then begin racing actually answering the question thus telling Paul everything he needed to know. However Paul was not ready for what happened when he asked this strange man the famous key phrase and neither were all of the FBI agents detectives and even the Governor who had made a special trip into town to watch.

e_7y1szljd,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing as a concerned citizen to discuss the ongoing debate regarding the retention of the Electoral College or shifting to a popular vote system for Presidential Elections. I am of the stronger belief that maintaining our current system of the Electoral College is beneficial for stable and balanced representation.

The Electoral College, as established in the Constitution, provides a balance between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. This mechanism focuses on the objective of enhancing the voice of each state, particularly smaller ones who otherwise may be undermined in a simple popular vote system.

While the detractors claim it can be confusing for voters and lends a higher risk of faithless electors, occurrences of such events are rare, as trust is rarely betrayed within the established elector slates of each party. Moreover, historically, discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote are extremely infrequent, with only five instances since the founding of our country.

There are several practical reasons for preserving the Electoral College. Firstly, it provides a certainty of outcome. The existence of a winnertakeall rule in nearly all states inherently reduces the likelihood of a dispute over popular vote. Secondly, it demands a nationwide appeal from a presidential candidate, acknowledging that no single region can elect a president, ensuring a balanced and fair representation.

Critics argue that this system leads candidates to focus only on swing states during campaigns, minimizing the focus on more certain states. However, while swing states may receive more focus during campaigns, it can be argued that energizing voters in these crucial states leads to higher information dissemination and therefore a more thoughtfully informed electorate.

Finally, the Electoral College helps overcome a shortfall in the representation of larger states due to the equal representation of votes in the Senate. For instance, a win in a populous state like Florida would give a nominee 29 electoral votes, while the same win margin in Wyoming would result in just 3 votes. 

While critics suggest that the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, I believe we should perceive it as a measure to preserve our federative system and safety guard the interests of smaller states, ensuring that the candidate who becomes president truly represents all sections of our country. Therefore, I kindly urge your support in advocating for the maintenance of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.",1.0

e_d5l5ihzr,1,"Dear 

I am writing to your state senator in support of retaining the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

As a student of high school, I know that the Electoral College is an important part of our democracy and that it should be preserved. The Electoral College ensures that the president is chosen by a majority of the people, rather than by a small handful of wealthy individuals. This system has been shown to be more accurate in predicting who will be the next president, and it is important for our democracy to stay strong.

My opponent would argue that the election by popular vote is more accurate and fair. They argue that the voting process is biased and that electors in particular are too often influenced by money and political propaganda. They allege that the election of the president is not a top priority for most Americans, and that we should instead focus on important issues like education and healthcare.

I believe that the election of the president should be a top priority for all Americans, and that the vote of the Electoral College should be preserved. I would like to see our democracy continue to be strong and reliable, and I believe that the vote of the Electoral College is the best way to do that.

e_tarchx2w,-2,"Introduction:
William Shakespeare's tragedy ""Othello"" delves into the complex theme of honor, exploring how individuals both perceive and strive for it. The play centers around the contrasting characterizations of Othello and Iago, portraying how their differing perceptions of honor influence their actions and lead to dramatic consequences. Moreover, these contrasting perspectives subsequently shape the characters' relationships with others, intensifying the destructive nature of their tales.
Body:
Perception of Honor:
The tragic hero, Othello, holds honor in high esteem and fervently believes it is crucial to maintain his reputation. Othello's perception of honor is closely intertwined with his military background as a decorated general. For him, honor is not merely about personal reputation but encompasses loyalty, dignity, and adherence to moral principles. This belief prompts his profound trust in Iago, as he perceives him to be a paragon of honesty and loyalty.
In contrast, Iago harbors a twisted perception of honor, viewing it as a means to gain power, influence, and revenge. Iago's concept of honor revolves around manipulating and deceiving others to achieve his malicious objectives. He perceives honesty as a weakness that hinders his ascent, leading him to relentlessly scheme against those who possess the qualities of honor he lacks.
The Drive behind Actions:
Othello's honor leads him to make decisions rooted in his unwavering belief in people's integrity. However, this virtue becomes his tragic flaw when Iago exploits it, planting seeds of doubt about his wife, Desdemona's, fidelity. Consumed by jealousy, Othello, driven by a desire to preserve his personal honor, succumbs to Iago's manipulation and ultimately commits the heinous act of killing his innocent wife. The overwhelming need to protect his honor impulsively drives Othello's actions, blinding him to the truth.
Iago's perception of honor fuels his vindictive intentions as he finds pleasure in tarnishing the reputations of others. By sowing the seeds of distrust in Othello's mind, he skillfully manipulates events, orchestrating a tragic chain of events. Iago demonstrates that a skewed sense of honor can drive an individual to wreak havoc on those they perceive as threats or merely pawns in their twisted game.
Consequences of Actions:
The consequences of Othello's misplaced honor are immeasurable. His unrestrained jealousy and subsequent actions lead to his own downfall, alienating him from everyone he holds dear. His marriage crumbles, his reputation shatters, and he becomes consumed by guilt and remorse, ultimately taking his own life. Othello's tragic fate serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the devastating consequences that arise when one values honor above all else.
Similarly, Iago's actions have a profound impact on his relationships with others. He manipulates those around him, with no regard for the devastation he causes. His deepseated jealousy and ruthless determination to maintain his position ultimately distance him from others, leaving him isolated. Even though Iago achieves his initial objective of tarnishing Othello's honor, he finds himself ultimately bereft of any honor himself, driven to his own ruin.
Impact on Relationships:
The notion of honor molds the relationships within the play, tearing them apart. Othello's misplaced trust in Iago shatters his bond with Desdemona, who becomes a victim of his misguided pursuit of preserving his honor. The once loving and respectful relationship between Othello and Desdemona is corroded by unfounded suspicions. Furthermore, the theme of honor fuels Othello's doubts about Desdemona, causing him to perceive her as dishonorable, leading to the tragic breakdown of their relationship.
The psychological manipulation employed by Iago also impacts relationships. He undermines the bond of friendship with Othello and desecrates the trust Othello places in Cassio, creating fractures between these characters. Iago's relentless pursuit of selfdriven honor poisons the relationships of those around him, unraveling the fabric of trust, love, and loyalty.
Conclusion:
In Shakespeare's ""Othello,"" honor functions as a driving force behind the actions of the main characters, Othello and Iago, significantly impacting their perception of others and themselves. Othello's honordriven actions ultimately lead to his tragic downfall, while Iago's distorted perception of honor destroys his relationships and eventually results in his own downfall. This exploration of honor profoundly illustrates the destructive consequences it can bring, leaving behind a shattered web of broken relationships and human tragedy.",1.0

e_48yffdi8,-1,"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Responsibility of Texting and Driving

Cell phones are everywhere! Everyone has a phone or some type of electronic device. These devices are very useful, but they can also be a distraction. Driving is a freedom that many people look forward to obtaining in their lives, but it is also a major responsibility. Some things go together, like peanut butter and jelly, but cellphones and driving are not a good match.

Driving and texting is one of the number one causes of traffic accidents.

Drivers should not be able to utilize their cell phone at any time while operating a vehicle because it distracts them from the road and decreases their awareness.

Cell phones can be useful while driving, but they can lead to distractions. Many people use cell phones to get directions when they are lost or stream music.

The apps that are used to give directions and to listen to music are great, but the notifications from other social media apps can be a major distraction. According to the NY Post, ""Americans check their phone on average once every 12 minutes  burying their heads in their phones 80 times a day"" NYP.

This study was done in 2017.

People check their phones more now than they did back in 2017 because there are more apps that people can download on their phones.

If phones were just used for giving directions or listening to music while driving, it would be okay, but everyone does not think to turn off their notifications so their phones become a major distraction. Therefore, it is a safer option to just not use the phone at all while driving.

Not only are phones a major distraction, they decrease awareness and slow a person's reaction.

When a person is driving, they have to pay attention to their surroundings and quickly respond when other drivers drive recklessly. If someone is on their phone, their awareness is decreased and they do not respond as quickly as they would if they did not have their phone in their hand.

The only thing that drivers should be focused on is the steering wheel and road.

In the end, using a phone while driving can cause accidents because it is a major distraction and it decreases awareness. When people use their phones and drive, they are putting their life and the lives of other people at risk. Even the most aware drive can get distracted by their phone. Using the phone for just a few seconds while driving can result in a major accident that could kill multiple people. The safest option for everyone is to simply stop, park, and use the phone.",0.0

First off, in paragraph 2, the author compares Earth and Venus saying ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" This means that if we could study Venus, we could find out more about what happened to make it so different than earth now. We would also be able to see whether or not Venus could support life like Earth can today. In paragrah 4, the author states that ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earht levels.

It wouldn't be easy living conditions, but at least it would work. In paragrah 5, the author says that since we wouldn't really need to take samples of rock, gas or anything else from above ground, then scientists wouldn't be risking their lives just to get information. They would be safe and sound up in the air while still being able to learn new things.

e_v5tw1wxg,1,"Dear senator, I think that the presidential election should be settled by popular vote. We people are being run as a country by the president, and we should be able to have more of an impact choosing who our president will be.

The president currently gets chosen in the Electoral College, a process in which the electors vote for President and Vice President after they are selected. This process flows very well and the president is chosen easily, so its good. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. The majority being 270 electoral votes and the first president to get to this number in the race wins. We the people are separated into states and the states get however many electoral votes based on population. So the bigger states get more say on who's President, but I mean that makes sense because more citizens live there. There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote.

You may think that the people are mainly voting for the President in the Electoral Collage process, but we're not. The people just vote for electors who in turn elect the President. Some of the slates of electors may even vote for who they want to and forget about what the majority of the state wants. At the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakesall system in each state. This means that if say Florida has twentynine electoral votes, then all twentynine go to the candidate who wins that state. ""So normaly candidates don't spend time in states they know they have know chance of winning, focusing only on the ""swing states"" and the larger populated states."" ""Swing states"" are states that pay close attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing candidates. This means that the states may pick the republican or democrat. Some states pick the same way every election. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. I mean what kind of madness is that, how are they supposed to know who to choose. Thats not fair and it shouldn't be settled that way. This all just proves that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Therefore the Electoral Collage shouldn't be the way to elect the President and VicePresident and should be either altered or in my opinion scratched. So then they should be elected by popular vote, so we have more control on who runs the country.",0.0

e_w31qja9t,6,"This shows that the author supports his idea of studying venus and that it is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The possibilites of exploring Venus are endless and I think it is worth it to find the answers. With the information we could find what we can do to further our knowledge. We also need to learn about other planets and how they behave. Having more info could lead scientists into finding other life and possibly find out what it could be like in the future.

Venus is also has the hottest suface temperature in our solar system even thou Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is till hotter. It has eruputing volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequesnt lightning strikes that happen on the surface of the planet. Scientist think that long ago Venus was like Earth but even now it still has some of the features that Earth has. It has the rocky sediment valleys mountains craters. NASA has plans to explore Venus. They have done fom silicon carbide tests that are simulations of the chaos of Venus s surface. One of the things is that they are still striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. So if there is a way that they are able to go there and get more samples from Venus then maybe that might tell the scientist what might have been there before and help them out with the previous clues as what happened. They also didn t think about how fast the computers we have today would be. But they also said that just imagine exposing a cell phone tablet to acid or heat compatible of a metling tin that must be what the heat is like on Venus. And despite all the dangers that are associated with Venus the study of it is still a worthy pursuit.

It was hard to find out all of the facts about this planetary visit, even though we have only an 0.0000001 chance of it. That's my opinion on why we need to keep trying and try even if they aren't even in space. There are more things we should explore about Venus, we just might need to find out more about it. We can make a new, better technology that is better than the one we have right now.

Overall, I think the author does a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The evidence provided is compelling and makes a strong case for why we should continue to explore this planet. While there are certainly challenges and risks involved in studying Venus, the potential benefits are significant and cannot be ignored.",0.5667753728125582

e_fx2vwk8c,6,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports his idea of exploring the planet Venus. He tries to give some facts about Venus and then goes onto talk about the similarities with the Earth and other planets.

His first and foremost point of view on Venus would be about how they are very similar to each other. He says that it may have been the most Earthlike planet in the solar system. He goes on to say that the temperature is over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what the earth experience is. His next statement is about how humans have tried to explore the planet and have made it a point to try and get them to land on it.

He also brings up another way Venus is dangerous is how we have sent spacecrafts to Venus but none have survived the landing. he states that no spacecraft has ever landed on this planet. He goes on to say that all of them were unmanned since they didnt have enough technology to be able to withstand the harsh conditions.

Another reason why Venus has a very good name is how NASA is trying to get something interesting out of the planet. He states that no spacecraft has touched the ground more than a few hours since they've been on Venus. He goes on to say that they haven't made it very far but they are trying to do it on their own. This would take years to discover. They are also looking to come up with ideas to help humans get closer with life on the planet if they get close to it.

e_vxpqomwc,-2,"The magnitude of the magnetic field around a wire can be calculated using the BiotSavart law and a selected integration path. The BiotSavart law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a current element Idl is proportional to the current, length of the element, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r from the element. 

To calculate the total magnetic field around a wire, we need to integrate the contributions from all the current elements along the wire. We first select an integration path, which is a curve surrounding the wire where we want to calculate the magnetic field. A common choice is the Ampre circuital law path, which is a circle centered on the wire. Next, we determine the incremental current element Idl, which depends on the current through the wire I and the length of the path element dl. 

Then, for each element Idl, we calculate the magnetic field magnitude dB using the BiotSavart law. We determine the distance r from each current element to the point at which we want to calculate the field along the integration path.  The direction of each dB element is perpendicular to the plane formed by Idl and the unit vector connecting Idl to the field point. By vector addition, we sum all the dB contributions to get the total magnetic field magnitude along our selected path.  

Finally, to get the full magnetic field vector at any point, we evaluate the total dB at many points along any closed curve surrounding the wire. The magnitude of the resulting total B vector is the strength of the magnetic field at that point in space. By systematically varying the position around the wire, we can map the entire magnetic field and visualize how it varies as a function of distance from the wire. In this way, the BiotSavart law and path integration enable us to calculate the magnitude and vector direction of the magnetic field for any desired point in space around a long straight wire.",1.0
e_9rcii1bv,1,"Changing the voting method to popular vote is a bad idea because in the 2000 election candidates did not pay attention to what they were doing and the voters don't feel unimportant. According to Bradford Plumer it is unfair that he or she will not get votes from states they know that they have no chance of winning. In the 2000 election ""a candidate has no hope of carrying their state."" The voters in the south are not the ones who should vote for him or her.

Although the electoral college has been in place for over 800 years there are many reasons to change it and it may cause problems in the future. During the 2000 election a group of states from California to Florida did not receive the election. It happened in 2000, but in 1998, when Obama recieved 51.7 percent of the electoral votes than Romney. According to Bradford Plumer if the president who got 51.3 percent or 301 votes was Electoral College ""the winner takes all"" system can not win because the voters in those twenties know they are going to vote for that candidate. In 2012 election ""Posner."" The senate is able to decide who should be our next president.

In addition to being unfair in some ways the electoral college may be a helpful enourmous process that may lead to an unimportant outcome and should be taken out of use. In the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't get to see who ran for president because they knew who would win over a state based on the population. People in those states felt that the electoral college voting was unfair because of the winner take all system. According to Richard A. Posner ""The electoral collage method is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" As stated by Bradford Plumer it seems like this is the case because voters in states that are large and have the same number of votes are treated differently. Voters in certain states are more likely to pay more attention to other campaigns than they would on in the national electors if those voters had voted on what they were doing. In 2000 Al Gore and Bush had won the election and went to Kerry. With that being said we should abolish electoral colleges because it is not fair.

In conclusion if we were to change the system the people of our country would feel disenfranchised in the way that they are voting for the president. The electoral college does not give the best representation to certain states it causes voters not feeling like he or she is contributing to the election and not being heard. I agree that the electors should be abolished because the person should have more of an impact on the voting system, and the Electoral college may not be beneficial to voters.",0.7
e_7i1xjnq4,5,"Making Mona Lisa Smile"" highlights the development of a revolutionary system, the Facial Action Coding System FACS, capable of analyzing human emotions. However, the proposal to use this technology in classrooms has sparked controversy, raising concerns about privacy and practicality.

The FACS system is an impressive advancement in technology, yet its use in the classroom is unnecessary. Teachers already possess innate abilities to sense and respond to their students' emotions. As technology expert Nick D'Alto points out, the human brain is capable of complex emotional calculations that FACS merely replicates artificially. Introducing this technology in classrooms would be redundant, and the cost of implementation would be significant.

Furthermore, the use of FACS in a diverse classroom setting raises privacy concerns. The technology, while advanced in recognizing emotions like confusion or boredom, lacks the capacity to understand the underlying causes of these emotions. Personal experiences and emotions of students could be invaded and scrutinized without their consent, potentially exacerbating their distress. Privacy is a fundamental right, and schools should not use technology that invades students' personal lives.

Moreover, adapting teaching methods in realtime using FACS technology may disrupt the learning process for other students in group settings. The implementation of personalized emotiondetecting computers for each student would also be impractical and costly, making it an unfeasible solution for most schools.

In conclusion, the use of FACS technology in classrooms to read students' emotions is unnecessary and impractical. It raises privacy concerns and is costly. Teachers can sense and respond to students' emotions without the assistance of technology. Instead, educational institutions should focus on humancentric teaching methods, where emotional understanding and connection are paramount. We should embrace human teaching over technological intrusion.",1.0

e_pk7x0x26,-7,Dear Principal I have read your policies you are considering on the usage of cell phones in school and I think that your second policy the one allowing cell phones in school and ability to use in only free time is the best idea. Yes I am one who may overuse a cell phone but that s not the reason I think allowing the use of cell phones is important. There are reasons that the ability to get to a mobile device such as a cell phone is important. There can be emergency cases in which a student may not be able to access any other phone or another person so the cell phone is easily an accessible option if we the students have one with us. If there were one of these emergencies and we didn t have a phone to use there may not be a way we can get help endangering ourselves and possibly others. Other ways of the to to to with other person can also be a important. There may be a time where we need something from home but what we need isn t information we would be fond of sharing with others. The cell phones would allow students to call home without being in an office with more than him or herself in the room and when calling your parents for the things you need it might be stressed a little if you don t want others around you to know. These are just a number of good reasons for you to allow cell phones in school. I think that these few reasons to support the fact that having a cell phone is a good idea. I strongly suggest you allow them in school for these reasons and do the good it.,0.05
e_3asf3b5y,-1,"Dear Principal,

I do not think that community services should be mandatory. This is because some people are just to busy with their own lives and can't take the time out of there day to help others. Community service takes a lot of time which is something most people don't have. For example, if someone was working 10 hours a day they would only sleep for about six or seven hours each night and then get up and go back to work. That leaves them very little time during the day. If you made it mandatory i feel like students will become more lazy than ever before due to lack of sleep and no free time. Also, I believe this will affect test scores in school by causing students to fail classes from being over tired. A student may not even try doing hisher best on tests because they know they won't pass due to all the extra stuff thrown at them. I really hope you understand my point of view and make a wise choice regarding your decision. Thank You.",0.9

This is a great way to get more students to express their emotions, but some schools don't have this technology in their schools. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it won't have any affect on the students, it will cost a lot of money to build, and it will be completely useless.

the idea of Even having This new technology in school is Not Valuable because it Won't Have any Affect On The students. The students face won't really matter to the teacher. they Will be Happy To see Their Teacher using this in Their classrooms. This will Allow Teachers to teach more And give better feedback. Students will have a better chance of understanding the lesson because they will know that they're learning something new. The other reason will explain that the use of this technology in school is useless.

the last reason The Use of this technology is not valuable is It will Cost A Lot of money To Build. if the usage of the technology in school isn't really valuable its not Worth spending money on new computers. Many schools will have to spend thousands on the hardware for this new technology. This will show why the use of this technology should be completely useless in a classroom.

the idea of even Using this technology in school Is Completely useless. It Is not very useful in A classroom because many students do not understand what's being said. This reason is the same as when the teacher just tells you what the students are feeling. If they were to use this in their class room they would just say hey, i can just read your emotions by clicking on the screen of the class. If you would be happy to know that your going to help them understand how to do this. These reason also explain why getting this used in schools are not valuable.

If we use this technology in schools it will probably be completely useless. The idea of this being able to read the students faces is just not valueable. Schools won't have any good outcomes from it at all, the cost's in the school budget, and it is pure waste. In summary the use of the emotionreading technology is not valuable.",0.7

If their has to be projects done over the summer it would be better for them to be studentdesigned.

The whole point of a ""summer break"" is to not have to do any work, we finally have time during the week to do other things then go to school. By not doing work over the summer you are not forgetting everything you learned because some of the stuff we actually use in out everyday lives. And even if we don't, we still wouldn't forget we would just need a little refresher on some topics. Which is what most schools do anyways when the kids get back. And even if we did the project at the beginning of the summer, most students wouldn't remember what the project was on. If the teachers were given the authority to assign the summer projects most kids would not do it. Some would forget, or simply just not want to because it is summer break.

If there was an option to do summer work or not I feel that, the students that want to do better will do that work. Maybe having a prize, extra credit, an automatic test exemption, or something would influence students to pick their choice wisely.

A studentdesigned project would be the best option out of those two things. Because as students we don't like to feel restricted on what we can and can't do with all of the guidelines. Studentdesigned projects could benefit each person and make every student feel more comfortable with what they are doing These projects would be a great thing to start off the school year with because they could be about their summer break and what they did. And instead of the ice breaker games that everyone in each class has to do, they could simply just share their project that they decided to do over the break. This option would also be a huge stress reliever on the teachers workload, with deciding what each person has to do.

Some people would say otherwise. That the kids need projects to keep them on target for the year. Or to already be practicing for their classes for next year. That it can only benefit us in our life. Parents could say that they will make time for their children work and remind them of what they have to do for school even on the break. Also that teachers guidelines would restrict the work to something appropriate, or meaningful to school.

In the end I feel that it is all up to the students and what they want to work on. Because as highschoolers self accountability is a real thing. The school already provides summer school and sol remediation over the summer for free that you can sign up for. So if a student is worried about their grades in a class or wants to get ahead they already can through those programs. Or even taking classes outside of the school with tutors. These projects could be a really good and efficient thing or a stressful unmotiving thing. And that would be all up to the school and administrators.",0.0
e_tuvat970,5,"Having technology to read a student's emotional expression is outstanding, or so Thomas Huang's new software for emotionreading capabilities might suggest. With the capability to read emotions and determine the degree of one, the Facial Action Coding System, FACS, provides the potential to recognize emotions of an person. As a computer scientist myself, I argue this new technology is not as promising as its creators suggest it is and does not serve the needs of its potential user base, particularly for teachers, but also other professionals such as law enforce, medical personnel, and politicians to a lesser extent as it requires expensive hardware, does not reliably detect mixed emotions, and cannot differentiate authentic and faked facial expressions or detect microfacial expressions.
Firs off, FACS is extremely pricey, costing nearly twenty thousand U.S. Dollars to purchase. With a price that high, many institutions cannot or even do not want to buy such a product even they had the funding to buy a FACS computer unit it's just too exorbitant for their meagerness budget. While Thomas Huang might suggest that his software will make its return on investments for those institutions, there are no studies nor evidence of the benefits for having a emotion detection computer unit that could make the price worthwhile. Therefore, it seems unwise to make such heavy investment with uncertainties as the results for most people who has to live under financial strains to meet everyday needs, a cost as great as twenty thousand dollars might mean they need to make a hard decision on whether or not to sacrifice other needs in favor of getting the computer.
FACS is not only overly expensive, but it is not also a very accurate system to detect mixed emotions and cannot differ facial emotions from authentic from false emotions. Dr. Thomas Huang argues in the article, that FACS can determine the mixed emotions through the weighted action unit. In reality, it is quite complex and hard for the program to differ between a genuine smile and a forced or fake smile, for a fake or forced smile would not engage one of the muscles in an genuine smile  a muscle that lift the cheekbone and corner mouth of your face. Without a capability to detect this muscle, a fake smile would pass through to FACS' software and interpreted the same way as an genuine smile. Moreover, Dr. Thomas Huang argues his computer software has a 83 percent accuracy, however, a study by Dr. Ebner in University of Bern shows that FACS could achieve only up to a fifty percent accuracy and not a 83 percent accuracy. Even with a lower accuracy as 50 percent, FACS does not differ well enough authentic smiles and false smiles which is unhelpful for those professions such as law enforce or politicians where knowing the truth matters more in some cases than anything else to them. 
As if this not is bad enough to not reliably read emotions, the program also can not detect microfacial emotions. FACS software needs several frame to detect emotion and a full motion of emotion must be shown to determine it correctly, but some emotions may only last only milliseconds thus, if the emotion doesn't linger long enough for it be processed through the FACS system then FACS can easily detect an incorrect emotion, or even no emotion if emotion is not shown. Dr. Ebner's team has done research and concluded the best software that exist right now is only at forty percent accuracy for determining emotions.",1.0
e_m7d7gw7k,1,"Dear state senator,

Since our nation's founding, the Electoral College has been a key player in the election of our nation's president. While it may not be the most democratic system, it is an important part of our election process and one that we should keep. Without the Electoral College, the presidency would be decided by a popular vote, which could lead to less representation for some states and more for others. The Electoral College ensures that every state has a voice in the election, no matter its size or population. 

But there is another side to this argument. Some believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that needs to be changed. They argue that the presidency should be decided by a popular vote, which would be more democratic and would give more power to the people. This side of the argument is also valid, and it's one that should be considered when thinking about the future of our election process. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an important part of our election process, but it's not without its flaws. While it's important to consider changes to our system, we should be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Instead, we should work to find ways to improve our current system and make it more democratic and representative. Thank you for your time and consideration.",1.0
e_0trnemu9,4,"Google cofounder, Sergey Brin believes that in the near future, we will have an advanced transportation system that is composed of autonomous cars acting as a type of public transportation taxi fleet, capable of reducing fuel consumption in half and offering a flexibility that is superior than what a bus system could offer, which he thinks will change the world significantly.  Google had successfully developed a car in which its driven more than half a million mile on various type of terrains and under multiple weather conditions without a crash or a mishap since its initiation in the 2014 and the development of BMWs Traffic Jam Assistance in which allows its cars handle the steering and accelerating and breakings by its system with the assistance of the driver for speeds lower than 25mileshour with the ability to switch back the driving task to the driver during unexpected traffic issues and accidents and work zones areas.

e_itjk8uxy,0,"You and I both know very well that we love to breath fresh air. Going out into the forest and taking a big breath of what is called ""fresh air."" Why cant we get that in an everyday life? I'll tell you why, because of polution. Cars are a ginormous part of polution, so what if we drove less?

In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars almost completely. The streets in Vauban are ""car free."" If you want a car, you have to park it at a local park garage for 40,000 dollars added onto your house. That isnt even worth paying for. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She lives in this town so she knows how it is. Giving up a car can reduce stress! Boy do some people need to give up cars.

America's obeisity count is getting higher and higher by the month. What if we gave up cars? people would have to walk everywhere! That's a good way to get exercise. In passage 1 it says ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Stores are helping people out so they can walk to get what they need instead of driving.

It will be so much less expensive in everyday life if you dont have a car. You won't have to pay for gas, you won't have to pay for car insurance and you won't have to pay for mantanence! You also will not have to pay something crazy like ""40,000, along with a home."" If I had to pay that much more money to keep up with a car, I would give it up in an instant. I barely have enough money to support the car alone, there is no way i can pay an extra 40,000 dollars!

Not having a car seems easier and healthier to me! You can walk more, so you get you exercise in everyday. You dont have to spend money on the car, no gas, no insurance and no mantanance! That means you can spend it on important stuff, perhaps on schooling! You also dont have as much stress on your hands. You dont have to worry about stopped traffic because you can just walk, ride a bike, or jog to where ever you have a desire to go. I say we get rid of cars all together in the United States of America.",0.0
e_5jlk3gg4,1,"Dear State Senator's Name,

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and student of politics, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that should be abolished in favor of a direct popular vote.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. However, as Bradford Plumer argues in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" this argument is based on a flawed assumption that the President should be elected by a ""national"" popular vote Plumer, 2004. In reality, the President is elected to represent the interests of the American people as a whole, not just the most populous regions. By using a winnertakeall system in which electoral votes are awarded based on the popular vote in each state, the Electoral College systematically underrepresents the interests of smaller states and rural areas, while overrepresenting those of larger cities and urban areas.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides a safety net against a tie in the national popular vote. However, as Judge Richard A. Posner argues in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" this argument is based on a flawed assumption that the Electoral College is a reliable indicator of the national popular vote Posner, 2012. In reality, the Electoral College system can produce a wide range of outcomes, including situations in which the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency.",1.0

e_fgmnwsnx,-7,"In this passage the author uses evidence to support the idea that human curiosity should overpower and enable us to explore the unknown and seemingly impossible regardless of the risks or repercussions. Venus Earth s closest neighbor to the sun poses one of these risks that could be overcome by desires of humanity. Despite its realtion in size and distance to Earth Venus is much different and inhabitable for humans due to its thick atmosphpere corrosive atmosphere. Though this seems a true that that our own planet is the planet, is t it worth the risk to discover more more and Venus Venus the the and for humanity to the Venus? The author of this passage seems to think so and does a great job of explaining why further exploration of Venus needs to occur regardless of the obstacles. First the author notes a specific way in which humans can encounter Venus landscape and conditions that is both safe and productive. In this way a form of spacecraft would not come in a contact with Venus planet because it would hover in its atmosphere and be able to collect information of the dily occurences on Venus. This circumstance would allow humans to study Venus from space instead of a ship that would send them to a a base on Earth. The author also notes that researchers are developing ways to make spacecraft to survive the conditions of Venus for a long enough period to provide information from its conditions. Based on the type of technology that we have today systems like these can be improved to resist the extreme conditions of Venus itself. If scientists are able to make products on Earth that could last through simulated versions of Venus here then there should be no debate whether its worth a shot or not. Overall the author makes great use of the evidence they have to support the idea that Venus is worth exploring despite its obstacles. They also do a great job of understanding about the developments and advancements of the technology that can further help scientists and the to to the ways to explore Venus on Venus. They wrap up their essay by saying that the exploration of the unknown should not be pushed aside because of the obstacles presented within it which is a great overview of the side in favor of adventuring through Venus altogether.",0.05

Schools make more accessible to access a school for the student can no attend to schools can be attend online from home and easy to access today technology, Help all the people to access to the internet and access to you works, Homework, schools and other access have the internet the is make your works easy to do it, Today can speaking with your teacher for your homework and your teacher can helping from your home, The internet help if you use correctly.

some student use the internet wrong use for play game and other thing end this make the student no make the works in home,However some student no have access to internet and no have access the schools and any transportation and is so far to go schools no have any access to learning, In this place have to works to help all the people want to learning and can no learning because no have any access to the internet, Or no have the money to buy devices to have access to internet how can learning I think have to works in that.

Learning is no hard if you want to learn you have to effort to do it, You have to propose with you because you no want learning you never learn because you no want always in the lief have problem in something, sometime you believe I can no do it because you no propose always have option, For example the student can learning reading book for math, science,language have many option to help the people can no have the option to learning and home in you school and internet, book, have many option.

All the people helping the world to learning the world was more better,All the people want to learn and some people no help the person to learn, In my opinion help the children learn before the children when growssomeone no want to learning,

And take this option because other people no have,In do not leave this opportunity, because maybe never you canhave and some people no have this opportunity.",0.0
e_ercho2cd,3,"Luke Bomberger had no idea how his life would change after gradutating high school. After graduating high school Luke Bombergers friend asked his if he wanted to go on a cattle boat. The reason they had the cattle boats was because World War II had just ended in Europe. After World War II ended many countries were crumbling. They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.

A reason Luke Bomberger joined the cattle boat knew it would be fun. Another reason Luke Bomberger joind the Europe on a cattle boat trip was because he said ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August, 1945. It took about 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean.

While Luke was on a trip to Greece he had his 18th birthday, Luke could've gone to the military, but his draft board told him to stay. By the time Luke was dicharged he had been on 9 cattle boat trips, that is the most of a sea going cowboy.",0.0

Scientist at NASA thought there might ve been ancient civilisation and it was just a landform that had a natural occurance. They took more pictures and they saw that it really is all just a landform because the landform has a shadow that makes it look as if their faces have formed. The face on Mars had a natural occurance and the face is really an ancient civilization. The landform has shadows on each of them that makes each one look like a face. Scientist think think that it is a naturalform but there is also a alien civilization.",0.95
e_3419wa9l,2,"So you think that the land formation coincedentally 'a face' crated on mars? Well you are wrong. The land formation is a face because of the shadows that are on it, the face is in a place where there is no water, and the face is a land formation.

The face is a land formation because of the shadows on it. The shadows are on the face because of the sun. The sun shines on the face and the shadows are made from the sun. The sun is the main reason why the face has shadows on it.

The face is a land formation because of the water. Water is not on mars so there is no way that it could have made a face on mars. The face is a land formation because of the water.

The face is a land formation because of the land formation. The land formation is a face because of the shadows on it. The land formation is a face because of the water. The land formation is a face because of the land formation.

So the face is a land formation because of the shadows on it, the face is a land formation because of the water, and the face is a land formation because of the land formation.",1.0

But do you still think they should get rid off the the electoral college? The electoral college process consits of 538 electors. Almost all of the electoral votes is requiered to elect the president, its a process that began with the foundation of our fathers' constitution. but i don't know if he will change this thing or not but i tink we should be aloud to choose our leader because it's not fair for the other presidents.

2. THe Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong' What do you think if obama didn't got more elctors he lost the presidency & got 39 electoral votes. I beleive that they should go away and make the president do what they want to do because some of them dont do there job in the first place, but they do it for a reason and not for the reason they think they are right. In the article it says that in 2000, al gore had more individual votes than the other candidates but less electoral votes. So if there was any tie it would just be up to the House of Representatives, the senates, etc. . . . I don't what to know about the Electoral College because some of the thing is good and bad. but if evry thing go the same then we will see different thing i'm talking about. it happened in 2000 in greece. The state sent two slates of electors to congress: one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for the senators. they can have up to fiftyfifty electoral votes to elect the president.

the winner take all method that they use for the electoral votes. its a very good system but they still have to go by elctoral vote & i know some of them would like to see what is going on.. The Electoral College is a good system they have but some of them isn't good cause if they go with that plan i think the things that is going on will not be good at all.. . . . I understand why it is not a good idea threw there is some problems in it but that's how it work the Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, as a person who opposes nthe election of the president. But he actually wuoln't do anything with it but i dont think so. The Electoral College avoids the problems of runoff election when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The voters in texas,for example, or Republicans in California. They have the power to select whom ever they want but it really is a chance for them that we can choose who is our president so they will be alright to pick whoever they like and not just the other guys.",0.7

With the rapid increase in car usage, the adverse impacts on the environment have become apparent, affecting human health, quality of life, and the climate. Conversely, communities that have begun to limit car usage, such as Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia, present a picture of healthier living, less pollution, and overall improvement in quality of life.

Fifth, limiting car usage can help to build community. When people walk and bike instead of drive, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors. This can help to build community and social cohesion.",0.6666666666666666
e_g06m3koi,0,"It is well known that cars have a significant impact on the environment. They contribute to air pollution, climate change, and noise pollution. In addition, cars are a major source of traffic congestion, which can lead to wasted time and fuel.

There are many advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can help to improve air quality. Cars emit a variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and reduce the risk of these health problems.

Second, limiting car usage can help to reduce climate change. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the rate of climate change.

Third, limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution, which can disrupt sleep and concentration. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce noise pollution and create a more peaceful environment.

Fourth, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Cars are a major cause of traffic congestion, which can lead to wasted time and fuel. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce traffic congestion and save time and money.

There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage. One way is to improve public transportation. This can make it easier and more convenient for people to get around without a car. Another way is to build more bike lanes and sidewalks. This can encourage people to walk or bike instead of driving. We can also make it easier for people to work from home or carpool. These are just a few of the things that we can do to limit car usage and improve our environment.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. It can help to improve air quality, reduce climate change, reduce noise pollution, and reduce traffic congestion.

The scientist even think that it was a Martain mesa which is one of the most common plants found around the American West. Scientist discovered it on April 5, 1998 with Mars Global Surveyor MGS. The face came out in April of 1998 and thats when Mars Global Surveyor came into the picture and was able to find out that it was actually a martian mesa. It was a long time ago when the spacecraft was discovered. A few years later there was an alien monument. They found it on Mars like an old mesa, which were common in the area of the the red plant at the time the Viking 1 took photos of it.

He also explained Taking the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and aviary that men the had a lot of fun. In the text it also said that Luke Merger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help in the Wars. In the text it said that when they were on the boat and they did what they were to do witch that is rare since they have to take care of the animals they find something fun to do so they don't get board. One of the games that they played was volleyball. They made that balls out of stuff they found around the boat. In the text it SIAD Helps pass the time.

I think from reading this people should participate it the Seagoing Cowboy program. I think it would an amazing appearance to some thing you didn't know you had an interest in and find that you did. Furthermore, I would love to do the program. Furthermore, I want to see new places that I have never seen and at the same time I am helping others at the same time.

e_5u82xr5i,-6,"French world Executives have Renewed Turbulence with the United States by Airline and Access Aviation executives in France are concerned that tensions may arise again with the United States over access to the transatlantic airline market. For example Europe and the U. S. have quarreled with open agreements that govern which airlines can fly to of the Atlantic and United world. The latest open skies agreement was signed in 2010 allowing EU and U. S. airlines to operate other flights to each other own territories. However the system has faced ongoing challenges including such of government, of national, and access to airport slots. There is worry that it of the the agreement could reignite tensions. The aviation relationship between Europe and Europe has always been fractious said, Marc Dufour CEO of French airline Air Europa. There are still many unresolved issues around competition investments and market access that could flare up again during negotiations. In particular French airline executives are concerned about access to slots at Paris Orly Airport. The 2010 agreement gave more slots to U. S. airlines at London Heathrow airport but did not significantly expand access at Orly. Orly is a critical hub for short haul European flights and French carriers want to ensure they maintain control of most slots there said Marie Lambert CEO of Transavia France. There is also an ongoing dispute over government bailouts and subsidies for national carriers like Air France KLM. U. S. airlines are to constitute unfair problems while other officials claim U. S. airlines have received subsidies and bankruptcy protections of their own. Resolving these subsidy issues will be key to a new open skies deal according to industry groups. Negotiations over a successor agreement are set to begin in mid 2021 as the current terms expire in 2025. French executives hope that with the the U. S. administration there is an opportunity for compromise. But they are also wary of the hardline stance some on both sides have taken in the past. With the airline, facing huge losses in the the coronavirus, the opportunity for finally the tensions in the ours relationship will never be higher. Overall while encouraged by the prospect of new talks French aviation leaders are preparing for what could be a bumpy road ahead with their U. S. counterparts.",0.95
e_a70ti71d,-2,"The room sat several thousands of people, centered around an holographic display on a stage. No one needed to present, one person was in charge of moving the holographs around, revealing dozens of images of the worlds beyond this solar system.
No man has ever set foot beyond Jupiter, yet they managed to send fivehundred thousand robots to fly to other solar systems in the galaxy. Why waste a life or a few thousands just to fly in space of nothing for a few several hundred months when they could send robots who can do the job just as well, if not better and faster?
On these displays held the attention of all in the room. Only a team of four people had seen them before, and now many thousands will see them for the first time. All the robots had reached their destinations and discovered a few worlds in each system. The robots were sent to solar systems containing Earthlike planets and have them investigate the surface of these places.
People began to murmur when they saw a tower on planet Gaea. The murmuring increased as more buildings revealed themselves on other planets. Several dozen of planets appeared and disappeared in the air on the holographic display. Each planet stayed in the air for five minutes, zooming in closer to the surface and out to see the entire planet again.
The last planet faded from view two hours later, and the room fell silent again, most people shocked and stunned by what they saw.
""What is the meaning of this?"" one person asked in the front row seat. A scientist who helped launch the robots.
Like a spell, the room burst into loud conversationsdebates, expressions of shock, questions being asked, and no response could satisfy them all.
A loud gonging sound rang through the stadium seating style room, and the audience fell into a hushed whispers, unable to stop themselves from discussing the planets they viewed.
""This, ladies and gentlemen, is the proof that we are not alone,"" he said, showing one planet. As he continued to talk, the planet rotated. ""The thing is, all of these planets show the buildings in ruin. No one is alive. They're all dead planets.""
""But why are they all in ruins? How do we know for sure they are not hiding?""
""We have been examining the planets for a year,"" he answered. ""There have been no movement. On all 428 planets. Of the 500 we sent, only 72 did not make it to their destinations. Of the 52 planets, there were no ruins found. The rest 376 planets, they all had buildingsas you saw them. Houses, large buildings, towers, roads. Even pools. Yet, none of them had anyone walk around. Drive a vehicle. There are, however, life forms, animals if you will, moving around. Acting the very same way Earth's animals move to eat, to fight, and to sleep. They are not intelligent as they never used any of the buildings for themselves.
""Ladies and gentlemen, I present you another evidence. They all committed suicide. Mass suicides.""
He pressed a button and it zoomed in to a building. The people could clearly see bodies on the ground outside the building, each of them holding a weapon very similar to a gun and aimed at themselves.
Another image showed similar scene, bodies with weapons aimed at themselves. The bodies on both planets were skeletons. The animals had not gotten to them on any of the planets.
The crowd was silent again.
""Does this mean whatever happened to them, will happen to us?"" the same questioner asked.
""That, sir, is the question we want to ask. The real questions are: why? What happened? How? What can we do to prevent this from happening? Anyone have a guess?""
The place was quiet, waiting for some brave soul to answer. Three minutes, still no one stepped forward to hazard a guess.
""Lucky for you, I do have the answers to them,"" he said, his expression growing grave as he continued to talk. ""What is amazing is not the ruins themselves, or the bodies. Or the fact that we are not alone. What is amazing is what drove them to killing themselves. Every last,"" he switched to another planet, ""one,"" another planet, ""of,"" another planet, ""these have been threatened with the space ships that came to them.""
A final holographic displayed showed a fleet of space ships flying past Jupiter.
""They are slave traders. We have one week before they get here.""
The room burst with anger words spewing out their feelings at this. Some of disbelief, of outrage, of despair.
""We know this,"" his voice grew louder to be heard over the din, ""because we found 38 planets with ruins and they have shown no bodies like the others do.""
The room fell silent again, his words silenced the skeptics.
""We have no option, we must kill ourselves before we become slaves to some some aliens. I am quite certain we will not enjoy being slaves.""

The fleet of ships landed on Earth. The doors opened on all spacecrafts. The people within stepped out, looking around and stared at the bodies with dismay.
""Not another one! Why do they keep killing themselves just before we could get here to make peace talks? Does no one in the galaxy want to do business in selling and exchanging fruits?""
""I don't know, it's a shame I saw on the monitors that they seem to have some tasty fruits here"" a guy said, walking to stand next to the first person.
The first person sighed, shaking his head. ""I guess we'll raid all the fruits and their seeds and move on. I hate this place, just like the rest.""
The group was silent for a moment.
""Well, let's get gathering, men and women,"" the second man said.",0.0
e_56hj8f77,1,"Election by popular vote would be a much better system because Electoral college can be unpredictable and is an unfair method of voting for voters.

To begin, The Electoral College isn't always predictable. In the article Does the Electoral College Work states ""laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" This shows that Electors from every state may not be chosen correctly or by trustworthy sources. These Electors may also have different requirements to do their job or how to become an elector, so states will may have different respones from their electors. Another example of this is shown in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong which states ""Electors could always defy the will of the people."" This demonstrates that the people who vote for these electors can easily be betrayed by the people they voted for. At any point of time these electors that should be voting for the candidate they are chosen to can change their mind and vote for whomever they please. Clearly, the electors for the Electoral College can be unpredictable and by the time are chosen it may be too late this is why we must change to popular vote.

In addition, The Electoral College is an unfair method of voting for voters. In the article The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it states ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance winning."" This shows that candidates aren't even going to certain states because they believe the Electoral College points won't be given to them. This is unfair to voters because they can't even make a proper decision on the president because they may only see one candidate. So this entire state is not fully informed on the election and may chose the wrong candidate when there may be one that shares more of their beliefs in the election. furthermore, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep ur despised method of choosing the President it states ""The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" This explains that potential voters may not vote because they know that candidate will most likely not win for their state. Depending on what type of people there are in that region race, religion, political point of view they may not vote on a certain candidate. So most voters know their one vote probably wouldn't make a difference. If we had popular vote everyone would have say in who is chosen for our president.

To conclude, We should change to popular vote because by using the Electoral College we allow unpredictable people to vote for entire states and inable voters to have an unfair election.",0.0
e_kvxwfa8x,2,"The article ""Unmaking the Face on Mars"" explains how the Face on Mars was not made by aliens but was actually made naturally and is called a mesa. The Face was not made by aliens but does remesble a human head, the Face was also a natural landform, and the Face finally is just a mesa even though people still believe that it was created by aliens.

The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. A quote from the article that supports my answer of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens and the it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose, eyes and a mouth is ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This quote supports my answer because it explains how NASA said that it was just a rock formation that resembled a human head. Another way of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all. A quote from the article that supports my answer of of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all is ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quote from the article supports my claim of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all because it explains how the rock formation was a natural landform after further reasearch was done and revealing to the world that the Face was not an alien monument after all. Finally, not everyone was satisfied so NASA did some more research and on April 8, 2001 they took a great photo of the Face and found that it was indeed a mesa. A quote from the article that supports my asnwer of how the Face was not created by aliens but was just a butte or natural landform is "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This quote supports my answer by explaining how the Face was not alien made and was just a natural landform.

In conclusion the Face was not alien made but was just a natural landform. The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. The face was also a mesa, and new highresolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAs Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is, a mesa.

e_nezw2v95,-6,"21 years day in the, NASA Mars mission took a picture Mars Mars they think that was a face that was on one of their Mars. They thought it looked just like a face because there was a shadow of the face in the image they captured on the surface of the Mars. But the scientists figured that it could have formed like that because it is a lave dome. The scientist figured that the lave dome formed like a human face because the face is about two miles from end to end and about a half of a mile long. The lave dome was also about the size of the Cydonia and the face was about to have shadow of an egyptian pharaohs face on it. So the NASA was thinking of a conspiracy way of aliens and other life and that there was an actual face on Mars. After awhile scientists figured out it was just shadows of the lave dome and the lave dome formed like an human head. The scientist even got another look to the lava dome to see it better and they saw that is wasn t really a actual face on the planet. The lava dome is just a illusion. But when the Viking space craft captured an actual face on the Mars it was an illusion and the lava dome was really just the lava dome. The lava dome is still there but there is no face in the image on the surface of the Martian surface.",0.95
e_ixgrx1z0,2,"In 1976 a picture was taken of the face on mars. The face is formed by shadows and rock formations. Many people think that aliens have created this face, but in reality there were no signs of life on the planet. NASA has proved time after time that there are no sign of alien activity around Cydonia. If there was any evidence of life they would release it to us immediately so we could learn more about them. This may be an ancient monument, or even just landforms like we have here on earth.

There is not enough evidence for this face being built by aliens. A scientist at NASA said ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". He also stated,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Marse."" The pictures from 2001 show a clear image of what it looks like with no clouds blocking our view. It shows that the formation was made by natural causes and not aliens. There should still be some sort of life if aliens had actually done it. The fact remains that the face is nothing more than a natural landform.

Many conspiracy theorists say that NASA doesn't want us to know the truth because they don't want people knowing how smart the aliens really are. These scientists work every day trying to find new things about space. They wouldn't hide something good like this from us on purpose. Their only goal is to help humanity. Most likely you wont see any news coverage of aliens anytime soon because their isn't anything to cover up.

NASA will continue to explore space looking for other planets that might support human life. We need more information about these places because who knows where else this might lead. As long as they keep searching then theres always hope that one day someone will discover proof that aliens do exist somewhere out there. Even though the face wasn't aliens, it got many people talking about aliens again which helps promote more discussion about outerspace.",0.9
e_dlh0kgze,5,"Teacher recognition is an important aspect of the educational experience. It is a way for teachers to acknowledge the hard work and dedicaiion of their students, and it can have a significant impact on student selfesteem and selfconfidence. In this essay, I will explore the positive impact of teacher recognition on students and present examples of how it can motivate otudents to work hard and strive for greater success. I will also compare and contrast different opinions on whether teacher recognition should be given for work that is not up to expected standards.

Firstly, teacher recognition can have a positive impact on student selfesteem and selfconfidence. When students are recognized for their hard work and dedication, they feel valued and appreciated. This can to increased selfesteem and sense of accomplishment. For exampae, a teacher may recognize a student for consistently coming to clais on time, participating in class discussions, or completing asoignments on iime. This recognition can be in the form of a verbal praise, a written note, or even a imall gift.

Secondly, teacher recognition can motivate otudents to work hard and strive for greater success. When students are recognized for their hard work and dedication, they are more likely to continue working hard and striving for greater success. For example, a student who is recognized for their excellent performance on a test may be more motivated to study harder for their next tesa. Similaray, a student who is recognized for their participation in class may be more motivated to participate even more in future classes.

However, there are some who argue that teacher recognition should only be given for work ehat is up to expected standards. They believe that recognizing students for work that is not up to expected standards can be demoeivating and can lead to a sense of complacency. For example, if a student is recognized for completing an assignment that is not up to expected standards, ehey may feel that their work is good enough and may not feel the need to work harder in the future.

In contrast, others argue that teacher recognition should be given for work that is above expected itandardo. They believe that recognizing students for work that is above expected standards be motivating and can lead to a sense of accompliihment.",1.0
e_3r34mgcb,-6,"Title The Mystery Behind the Face, In A Speculative Journey The intriguing face known as the Face on Mars has been numerous ways of the of the discovery. The enigma surrounding this distinctive land formation has made the imaginations of scientists, and the general people alike and scientific investigation due with a certain level of skills to make an engaging narrative. The Face on Mars initially discovered in 1976 has been captured by multiple Viking Orbiter cameras and remains elusive in origin and formation. The geological feature resembles a human face with its broad noselike features narrow bands running across its eyebrow and an overall visage that creates a striking resemblance to our own planet s terrestrial landscapes. Those who have created the Martian face can speculate on the potential of extraterrestrial life that could be responsible for creating the structure. While there have been various theories on the origin and development of the Face no concrete evidence has been presented to provide a definitive answer thus far. Some theorists contend that the face of evidence of a human civilization that at the very least could be an amount of the human life. However the conjectures are believe that the assumptions is a hard fact to the the claims. As research on the Face has has gained more in the of, the scientific ways began to take information into the that is represented. One such investigation emerged from the Mars Global Surveyor MGS launched in 1996 which successfully examined the Cydonia region where the Face is located and gathered information on its physical characteristics as well as the surrounding geology. The picture has a vital evidence on the structure and composition a mix of the iron, and the metallic mesa. Understanding the chemical composition of the face aided in further theorizing about it origin. However one of the significant outcomes of the MGS investigations remains ambiguous. The Face is not entirely visible to the human eye owing to its location within a depression. The MGS by its design could not take images of the outermost region of the depression. Additionally due to the orientation in space the Mars Global Mars did not also view the face at a similar angle causing the illumination effects. Despite these limitations the MGS has have refined the images and understanding of it, enabling a more accurate assessment of the face in relation to the face. In recent years satellite conditions and further created the Martian Mars have been our world of the and and its environment. The Cydonia region has been found to be rich in complex ancient structures and unusual geological features that point to a more intricate and mysterious history to the planet. With every new discovery the scope for comprehending the enigmatic properties of the Face broadens. Meanwhile the conditions in the world of astronomy and astrophotography and and improvements in the and and and lead to the striking natural images that the on from the and and and to the the of the the face. Such technological breakthroughs only serve to fuel the imagination and fuel further investigation into the myriad possibilities this celestial landmark represents. In conclusion the mystery of the Face on Mars not only draws immense ways from the, but also serves to redefine our perception of the universe we inhabit. The Face on Mars in this regard acts almost like a metaphorical symbol of our collective wonderment and the potentials held in our ongoing quest for knowledge. The ambiguity of its origins accompanied by the seemingly endless possibilities that arise from its very existence further cements the importance and intrigue surrounding this fascinating celestial enigma. As scientists and enthusiasts continue to explore the cosmic frontier we we believe that the Face on Mars is not be an natural mystery that makes our collective life and keeps our our life in life.",0.95

merica itself is going down the drain,and its going down 30 miles to the gallon,and the EPA is not doing anything about it. America is the most polluted country in the world, and it all started with the cars. We have to do something about that.

In Paris they have had almost 4,000 drivers that had gotten ticketed for driving their cars. I know you are going to say you are going to buy a car,that is not a good idea you can get a fine of 22 euros. In France they have banned driving to try to get more people to ride bikes or just use the public transportation to take them where they need to go. So it's a good thing to know that people are trying to make this country better.

There are other reasons why you do not want a car,like the gas prices. They are going up higher and higher. They can go up to the point where you can't even get the gas out of the tank. Also there are alot of places that do not let you get the fuel you need to put in your car. So what you need to do is use more ecofriendly ways or you can also walk or take the public transportation. But the most important thing and the most important thing is that people need to be more open minded and stop buying cars and start riding a bike and taking the public transportation.

The other reason why the car is not the best thing for us humans are because it makes us lazies. We are getting lazy,and laziness is not something to brag about. We need to get our hands into the dirt and get our muscles strong from riding a bike. In the world today you are not going to be able to drive anywere you want. You need to be more mindful and get out the house to do what we all should do. The world today is going to go down to ruins if we do not do something and that is going to make us lazy,and we do not want that to happen to us. So we need to go out and do what is best for us humans and what is best for the world.

The world itself does not need that much more air pollution and you are not going to like the way the world is going to look if you don't do anything. People need to start riding a bike,walking and using the public transportation for transportation. If you do not do this you will never know how it is to ride a bike and walk because you will think you are all powerful and you won't know what it's like if you need to do anywork. So the best thing and the best way to do something is to start to change the way we live and start walking and riding a bike.",1.0

e_55b326fn,2,"Have you ever squintted your eye's about something? Well, there is. There is so much conspiracy theories out there, and I have three theories that support my positves. I'm going to give my opinion about this ""The Face on Mars"" theory.

In the first picture they took of the planet in 1976, it just so happens that they were taking photos of it every time, but that is when you can probably tell if the aliens were real, or not. So, what if they saw an acutal or something like that? Scientists will know what it was, and there is no evidence to back that up.

My second reasoning is, that the sun is so hot right now, we havent been there in more that three decades, and a lon of time. They even have photos from 1976, like the ones they took in 2001. They have one of the most clear pictures to ever be taken. In the picture, they have taken a ""3D altimetry 3 times bigger and compared it to Earth"" Pictures 3,4,5, and 3. ""It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin.

When the planet is near the sun, in the sky, we can see a strange looking face, or even some weird looking one. Why would we be thinking that there is an ancient civilization on mars? Its hard to say this, because if you'd look at the picture from another planet you probably will notice something that is different from the one you are looking at right now. While they have shown that it is just a natural landform on the red planet, I think it may have been one of the greatest things yet, to be discovered by aliens.

There are pictures in magazines, talk shows, and even a bank. You can just look at the photos to see what the pictures actually look like. Even though they have pictures and videos, I cant say that they are truly logical with what they're saying. When it comes down to earth, many people wonder why we haven't actually seen any aliens on the surface of Mars, or maybe even in outer space. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" by the Office of the Federal Register it states that the ""Evening Star"" is a huge rock formation. Whether you see it or not you will always find it next to it.

All in all, these are the explanations to why the face of Mars is not real. Its possible that it isnt real, and if they were, they should have found more evidence of it being fake. We should not be living on an abomination of what we see, unless we have pictures or videos of some sort of extratriatrion in outer space.",0.7
e_9jmrxoqa,5,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can help them understand what emotions are, how they make you feel, and maybe even learn how to have different facial features. In paragraph 6 Dr Huang states ""A classsroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" That statement proves that by using this software teachers will be able to change their lessons if their students aren't interested enough which could result in better grades for more students. The Facial Action Coding System also shows exactly what your feeling just by looking at your face.

e_4ilxlyed,4,"Many believe that semi or fully autonomous cars are a bad idea. They are not truly autonomous vehicles, which means that there is no real way they can take control of their own car when they need to. Other arguements over these cars include, if they are in trouble, who should take over the car?, and who is to blame? These are two questions you have to ask yourself. Although semi and fully driverless cars are in our future, they do not have the real world implications that would make it dangerous to human life as we know it. No car has been running on a computer, there would be problems with sensors on the car, and there would be to much damage if it is in an accident.

No car on the road today is completely computer controlled. When the computer is supposed to drive, you have to take control at all times. In most states the driver is notified when the car should take over, but in some states and states it will not. A driver can be alerted to the danger of an accident, and can sway the decision on how much time and safe it is to actually drive. But in states such as Idaho, South Carolina, or Ohio, there are drivers who are distracted when it comes to a car. The person on the road may have gotten distracted by something or maybe was not really paying attention. When you think about the cars, that could mean that they could end up dead or if that person was to die.

Another problem with the reliablitly of these cars is the technology inside of them. When there are problems with driverless cars, so how can they be able to alert them? If their car were to have a malfunction and it needs help? Who would be blamed? The manufacterer or the driver is to blame, because what if it was an accident? Would the car be responsible for driving itself, or should it have been on autopilot in the first place? No. The person who bought the vehicle would have to be paying attention to the road, as it say in paragraph 23. When the computer fails and doesn't want to crash, they are not going to know when they should take control or braking, which is why it does not work on its own right? This is another problem with the cars being driven by sensors, allowing them to operate on their own.

With all of that said, who is responsible if the car is in an accident or it kills somebody? They are not really the people to blame, if they know they're in an accident. With these cars it would be possable, but even then there are dangers. This could go down the drain and would cause problems. These cars would have to be fixed before the car relases the information to the driver to ensure they can handle the situation at hand. The driver must take over at any moment, so it is not just a car that can drive on its own.

I am against driverless cars in the world. We may never know until we see the technology that will protect us from a dangerous accident. In the future, cars will get better than the ones we use today. It is possible, but we are not completely responsible for it. What happens if that happens? How do we know to trust them to be in control of what is going on outside of the car, when it may not even be safe to drive on the street? If you don't want to feel safer than you are, think about how i would like to make things better for me.",0.7

e_4pslki9r,-7,Dear Principal Changing the policy to having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is unfair. Many students may not be able to make a B average. Sports and other activities give many students only a little time left to finish their homework and to study for test. If the policy changes then they will be to their classes and have no time for anything else. Their lives would consist of only the sport and schoolwork. This would be highly bad for their health and could possibly make them feel angry and frustrated. Another reason is that changing the policy could make a lot of people not be able to participate which will also hurt the team or group. If an important player could not make the game just because of getting something under a B average it would hurt the team and the outcome of the game. No school wants to lose every game. A grade 3 average would be a to a a the school. If someone got a 79. 4 that would average to a 79 which is only one point away. If someone was that close it would be unfair to him or her. A grade C average is reasonable because a C is technically passing and it would allow students a better chance. Changing to a B average is to high of standards for someone who is so busy. Also some people are just bad at schoolwork and can only manage a barely passing grade. Those people should not be excluded from anything just because they are not able to process information as well as some others. Extra activities and sports are an important part in many students lives. It keeps students active and allows them to socialize with friends. If they were to to have a number of a to is above 70 it could be them to them. For many people they rely on sports to get them to college and to get scholarships. For some people sports help them lose their frustration and relax. Kind of like a cruise to get away from the world and to just concentrate on having fun. Even though having good grades are important so is having fun and getting active. Changing the policy to a grade B average to be allowed to participate in sports of other activities is a horrible idea. Active activities should be encouraged not took away.,0.05
e_fafu2tk8,-7,In 1976 NASA found something pretty odd on Mars. What did they found? They found called the Face on Mars. NASA has took new highresolution images to study. People believe it was created by aliens other people believe it s just a natural landform. On May 24 2001 NASA noticed something strange. So they snapped some photos and they spotted a shadow likeness of a human face. But it was just shadows. Scientists had found out it was just another Martian mesa that a the mesa. Maybe it is just an illusion. But the Face on Mars has become a pop thing featured in many and books. This is likely not just a a conspriracy theory. NASA noticed that there was no ancient civilization on Mars at any time in the past. Only few people believed it was an alien creation.

Anxious web surfers waited until the image appeared on the JPL wesite... sadly for them it was a natural landform. No one was satisfied. Skeptics say that the aliens were hidden by aliens. All these questions didn nt stop mission controllers. The mission controllers got prepared to look again. They state that they don t pass the Face often. There is alot more ways to prove that the Face is just a landform and not something created by aliens. NASA has done tons of research to prove it is a natural landform. NASA took years to find out what it was. It might be shaped as a face but it was nt created by aliens. Would nt you think that if aliens were on Mars you would they created other things? They searched and searched but there was nt anything odd about Mars. So why would you be worried about a landform? So if you plan on thinking the Face on Mars was created by aliens just ask yourself How? We all have illusions that our mind trick us about maybe this is yours.,0.05

e_mccukkk3,1,"Honorable Senator,

I am penning this letter to express my belief that transitioning to a popular vote system for the presidential election in the United States would be more beneficial than maintaining the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost managed to substitute the Democratic electors with new ones who were against John F. Kennedy. There have been instances where electors have declined to vote for their party's nominee and instead cast a decisive vote for a candidate of their choice. The electoral college system is unjust to voters due to the winnertakesall approach in every state. In the current system, it is the electors who choose the president, not the citizens. The Electoral College's way of electing the president can discourage voters who believe their candidate has no chance of winning in their state. Individuals who participate in presidential elections are those who wish to express a political opinion, not those who believe that a single vote could determine the outcome of an election.",1.0

e_kxdf028z,1,"We run our elections by a process called Electoral College. This process has 538 electors that vote for presidient. In order for you to win the Electoral college you must have more then half of the votes. There are pros and cons to this process, and I believe that we should keep our electoral college. The process is really very simple, its just that the people have to understand whats going on.

Under the Electoral College there are 538 electors in play. There are twentyseven electors given to each state plus the one given to the District of Columbia. All of these electors are chosen by the state's party. The people then vote for the electors whom they wish to represent them then they vote for president. So that way the president is only elected by the electors.

There are many cons to the electoral college. Some of these cons included that the people are not always voting for who they think they are voting for, and they can't always control who they vote for. As written in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" by Bradford Plumer. The cons are that the people dont really vote for the president that they are thinking. They are voting for electors who then vote for the president that they wish to have. This could mean that the person that you voted for could have lost the electoral voting process.

There are many pros to the electoral college. The pros are that the electoral college has a set number of electors. This means that the people cant easily be scammed and the votes will be evenly spread out. It also means that the electors are always fair and will never lie to their state in which they are electing their president. The electoral college also makes sure that the president is elected fair and legally.

The electoral college can be a little bit confusing, but they are all in place so that the process will be fair and accurate. The people are not always the ones voting for who they wish to have president. We have to trust that the electors will vote the right way that they are supposed to.",1.0
e_b8i8jqk4,6,"The authour suggets that exploring Venus is worthy despite the dangers for several reasons in the article because of its history, its atmosphere, and there should also should be an explorer who is willing to look deeper into its history.

One of their reason why they think that is worth it to explore Venus is because of its history. In the passage it states that "" Earth, Venus, and Mars , our other planetary neighbour, orbite the sun at different speeds. these speeds sometimes put us closer to Mars othe tme closer to Venus . . . each planet, takes a different amount time to do a full orbit of the sun "", this shows that the auther know the difffernt histrorys of Venus, Mars, and the earth and they dont just come to say that they think Venus is worth it , they have the information to back it up .

The second reason therer is to explore Venus despite the dangers because of the atompshere. In the article there are some paragraphs that tell you about Earths atmosphere on planet Venus and in the paragraiphe s. 5,6, and 7. In the article it says "" Venus has a dense atmoshere of almost 97% carbon dioxide coverage. Also, with temperatures and atmospheric prssure is extreme, it presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes,and it often have storm and has lighti ning strikes every two minutes .

The thrid reason why they think it is worthy despite the dangers to explore is because of the explorers. It states in the paragrahpht 8 "" There has been humans traveling to another planet, the Earth and beyond should not be be limited by dangers, doubts and doubts"". In this paragraph it tells the reader how they found the auther was not just in his job studying planet Venus but they were really into studying planets Venus and they wouldnt give up exploring Venus even there are risks.

I think that the passage shows how they got the info and reserach to do about Venus .This shows that they didn't just choose it right out to explore. In fact it had some details. I think it shows to the readers how serious it is to explore the different planets also and not to stop even there is dangers but to keep going and getting the history of all of these plants and figuring what is really going on with those planets.",1.0
e_t0garcf2,2,"While the Face on Mars looked unusual upon its discovery, further analysis reveals it is merely a natural landform created through geological processes rather than alien activity. The evidence clearly shows the formation was shaped by erosion rather than intelligent design. 

Some key claims that support the Face being natural include its irregular shape that does not resemble a standardized face. If created by aliens as a calling card, it would likely have been more symmetrical and detailed. Additionally, similar landforms have been found on Earth created by natural forces rather than extraterrestrial intervention. The Face also aligns with the surrounding geology of the region. 

Specific evidence from the article reinforces this. Later images with higher resolution show the Features flaky texture indicative of wind erosion over time. Its contours follow the slope of the hill rather than appearing artificially implanted. The dark slopes around it are of the same material, demonstrating it did not arrive preformed from another planet or star system. Contextual photos of the area reveal dozens of other unintended shapes in the Martian landscape that were randomly created by environmental factors.

In conclusion, while the initial discovery of the unique landform excited speculation of alien visitors to Mars, scientific analysis shows the Face is undoubtedly a product of natural geological processes rather than intelligent design. Its imperfect shape and context within the surrounding terrain all point to an innocent result of erosion rather than a message intentionally placed by an alien civilization. For these reasons, most NASA scientists now agree that what was once thought to be proof of life beyond Earth is in fact just a natural rock formation that occurred independently of any extraterrestrial intervention.",1.0
e_ae30midv,5,"The claim for ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is using technology to read the emotional expressions.

The text states,

""Eckman has classified six different emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" Then it also states,

""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" Dr. Huang states that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored....""

It also says ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It states that Dr. Huang thought it could read the student's emotions such as boredom or confusion. It also says Dr. Huang was hoping to convey a more effective lesson...

The claim is that if that tech was to come in our lives, it could affect it in a good way or a bad way.

It said that the Mona lisa ""had a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry."" The text states ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" The text also says "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" The facial fexress for each emotion varies because some people express emotions differently by facial expressions to be sure. The Mona lisa's expression to show that she's happy because it had a 63 percent happy, 3 percent disgusted, 12 percent fearful,and 5 percent angry.

It said 44 percent happy,6 percent disgusted,and 2 percent fearful and 6 percent angry.

The text states you can detect someones emotions by the way they look at things.

The Monalisa was 83 percent happy and 9 percent anger, 3 percent disgusted, and 1 percent fearful.

An example of technology using the emotions on someone would be the TV in your house that does all the things, such as turn on the TV and pick a showor a game room in a house. They're all using technology to do that for you.

There will be more and more new technology because of everything that happens in around the world.

There's even things with the internet and what's going on to it.

The claim for ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is using technology to read the emotional expressions. It states in the text that Mona lisa was 83 percent happy. But it also said she was on 9 percent sad, and the other 9 percent were sad too. What I mean is that she could have the emotions in her face for all of them.

And the Mona lisa's facial expressions would have said the emotions for it. She could have looked 83 percent happy and 9 percent bored or 9 percent bored.

Dr. Huang thought that this technology would be good for students to get their lessons. He thought it could modify their lessons for their grades to increase.

It said they could do that at school and at home.

The claim for ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is using technology to read the emotional expressions. It states that Mona lisa's facial expression showed 83 percent happy and 9 percent scared. The Mona lisa's emotion expressiosn changed everytime. It said to use it in a classroom to get the students grades to increase. It also said that it can be used for other things like your tv at home. They could use it for games to help you get your lessons done.

The Mona lisa's facial expressions changed as it says in the text and the more technology it is, the more it goes.

The Mona lisa's facial expression was 83 percent happy with 9 percent being scared.

And it said for many things to be able to get students grades to raise.",1.0
e_vg8e41fc,1,"Dear, Mr. Senator

I think that we should keep the Electoral College. I believe this because the founding fathers established it in our Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors , meeting of the Electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

First off, when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. Then those electors go to the state Capitol and cast their vote for President. Most states have what is called a winner take all system that awards all electors to winning presidential candidate. For example, if Obama were to win the entire state of Florida he would get 29 out of 29 possible electoral votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely because of the fact there is always an even number of electoral votes. If it ever happened though, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. Because each state only has one vote its possible for a single member of the delegation to make his or her own state choose the president. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.

In conclusion, i do believe we should keep the Electoral College. It's the way America was founded and how its going to stay. We need to make sure we don't change something that works perfectly fine already.",0.9
e_bph1vqyr,5,"The use of technologhy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in a lesson. This would allow the teacher to change the lesson and maybe help the confused students better understand what is going on in whatever lesson the students get confused on. It is not always easy to recognize when a student does not understand what is going on in the lesson. Most classes have like 15 or more students in the class room. I feel like this can help with that situation.

Another way it can help is it can tell when a student is becoming angry with a student. The system would tell the teacher what a student is feeling. If the teacher sees that a student is mad and another student was the cause you can get help for them and take them to guidance and talk it out. That way the student would not get angry and hurt someone else like they might hurt if they got mad enough and were to do something to the other student.

I do feel that using this technology in the classroom could be very helpful. I also think that it could be very useful.",1.0
e_akf8zpxj,5,"Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a fascinating article that describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can identify human emotions. This technology is impressive because it enables computers to recognize and interpret the emotions of people.

The text states that,a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'Dr. Huang predicts.""then it would be able to modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor.'This show that the facial recognition can help students to learn more. The system can help teachers alot in schools to let them know what they need to change to teach better.

e_s25y4vaj,4,"My position on driverless cars arising is that i think it is a bad thing. There are many reasons why it is a bad idea to have driverless cars. There are many things that could happen with driverless cars. For example what happens when the car has to make a decision and it can't make it in time. The cars would also have to be made with sensors and that means that it would have to have more technology in the car. The technology in the car is also very dangerous to have because if the technology is hacked then the driverless car is hacked and then the driverless car would do anything the hacker tells it to and that is very dangerous.

My first example is that if there is a problem with the car that makes it not drive itself anymore it would be very hard to fix. The driver would not be able to do much to fix it either so that means it is very dangerous. There are also a lot of things that could go wrong with the technology in the car that makes it work and that means the car is going to break down. If the car breaks down then it would be very difficult to get it working again. If it broke down then it would be hard to know what is wrong and what is right with the car and that means that it is a bad idea to have a car with all the technology in it to break down and not know whats wrong with it.

The second example that i have to prove my claim is that if the technology in the car breaks down then the car would just drive itself and not stop. If that was the case then it could lead to a lot of problems and a lot of people getting hurt because it would just drive itself. It could also just drive off a cliff and kill everyone in the car and the people in any other cars on the road at the time. The technology in the car could also just stop working and that would also lead to a lot of problems because the car would not work anymore and the technology in the car could also just stop working and it would lead to the same outcome that happened before when it stopped working and it just drove itself. The technology in the car would have to be upgraded a lot and it is going to cost more money than just having a car without the technology and that could lead to people getting robbed of money to pay for the upgrades to have the driverless cars.

My last example is that it will be expensive to have a driverless car and it will be more expensive to fix them than a car with out any technology in it. The cars are also not going to be cheap to make and the parts are also going to be very expensive and if it breaks down it will cost a lot of money to fix and that is going to lead to the cars costing more money to buy and the cars are just going to end up not being a very good idea to have because they would just be more expensive to make and fix than just having a car that doesn't have technology in it and the cars will also not be as safe to be on the roads and they will be very hard to drive and it could end up with a lot of people being killed because the driverless cars are just not going to be safe and the cars could end up killing a lot of people on the road and that would not be a good thing.

I hope my position on driverless cars is that it is bad idea because there is a lot of danger in having a car with technology that is in it that could end up causing problems for people and that would be bad and it could also cost a lot of money in the end to have a driverless car that is dangerous and it will not even make it safer for the people on the roads and it will end up costing more money than having a car without any technology in it and the driverless car will end up costing a lot of money and they will end up costing people a lot of money in the end for the driverless cars. The cars will also cause a lot of problems with people on the roads and that could lead to a lot of accidents on the roads and that will end up being a very bad thing. I hope you understand why my position on the driverless cars is not a good idea because the technology in it is dangerous and the cars could end up being very dangerous for people and it would end up costing a lot of money for people to buy a car that is dangerous and the cars are going to end up killing a lot of people on the roads and it would end up being a very bad thing for the people on the roads.",1.0

To be if the both want kinda the same thing it would help the people not the presedent it only gets them votes and votes are nouthing to me or others. 2. second i think we should keep it beacuse you can tell who voted and not the people that voted because you get a sticker that said i voted so that puts an place that you have voted or not and if u dont u have some time to do it or there will be anourther person who takes and votes in ur place and u wont be able to vote. 3. because the the college are full and the vote takes up for them to vote and they have to vote till the state want to vote the ansd the to in the electoral vote so having the electoral college will allow u to be able to vote in the the the the be ing going to vote and that is a to of the people in the contonet and the the and the only vote the others around so u can have a vote of what you want to be be a president of the united states.. third haveingf the electoral college will help tho ones who cant get out to vote and be able to do it just about any wear your at and that will be help full to me and othere because im nort allowed to vote yet so it comes in handy in many ways to us and other people to ther united states.,0.05
e_y3sohljp,-1,"Have you ever asked one person for advice? Maybe he or she is the only person you ask for that. If that's the case, then you should get into asking more people for advice, because you can improve your social skills, and it can help you understand how other people see things.

Improving social skills can make it easierfor people to ask for advice. When asking for advice, people need to self advocate, express feelings, and more. If none of that is done, then how elsewill they get what they need? Social skills is also another way of making friends. The more someone has, the easier it will be to get the best advice. There are students in school that don't feel comfortable talking to a teacher or consular, because they dont feel secure with themselves. Social skills can be a great way to get advice from them, because that can teach students how to be secure, and it get what they need if their friends can't help them.

Seeing other viewpoints can be a great way for people to get advice. If a friend says something, and another friend says something else, then it will be good to understand why they are saying what they said. It is recommended to experience both viewpoints and decide which one fits best, if needed. When both perspectives dont fit, there is always someone else with something completely different.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects.

And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

e_ctycvr0k,6,"Therefore, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, and the author effectively supports this idea in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" 

The author convincingly argues that studying Venus is a worthwhile endeavor, despite the many dangers it presents. This is supported by the fact that Venus shares similarities with Earth and its close proximity to our planet, making it a valuable and fascinating area of research.

As the author points out, while Venus may seem daunting with its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, corrosive clouds, and extreme temperatures, it also holds potential for discovery and advancement. This is evidenced by the previous attempts made by NASA to explore Venus, even though they were ultimately unsuccessful due to the harsh conditions.

Moreover, Venus holds potential for new understanding of our own planet. As the author states, Venus likely had oceans and could have supported life in the past, making it a valuable comparison to Earth. In addition, current features on Venus, such as its rocky surface and familiar geological formations, provide insight into Earth's own history and development.

Furthermore, studying Venus holds potential for the future. With the advancements in technology and space exploration, NASA is working on a new spacecraft to further study Venus. This showcases the importance and potential benefits of studying this planet.

In conclusion, the article effectively supports the idea that exploring Venus is a valuable pursuit, despite its many dangers. Its similarities to Earth, potential for understanding our own planet, and potential for future advancements make it a worthwhile and exciting area of research. While the dangers of Venus cannot be ignored, its potential for discovery and advancement make it a worthy cause for exploration.",1.0
e_e2v7qx7l,1,"Dear Senator,

I believe that we should change to popular vote for the president of the United States.

The reason I believe we should change the election to popular vote instead of keeping the Electorial College is so that our president can remain in office and still represent the people . Because you can't always trust your electors to stay true and vote for them but if you rely on the electoral college that is how we should handle things.The Electoral college is just unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational.

Also the people in this country may not agree on the president but i strongly feel like our president is not in charge of anything in the country . If we do that we will be better able to have presidents that are willing to put in the effort and fight for our country and thats why we should use the the Most popular vote system instead of using the Electoral college. We are the ones who are going to try and keep us happy and not vote for a presidential canidate that the citizens want to be president.

For the sake of the people i really think we should just tamper with popular votes rather than Electoral college. It is not fair that they are giving us the rights to vote and to choose our own president. If we did that the citizens vote will be able to qualfiy the president without the congress not having the power to pick who we want for president and our president will not change his mind like he did for if you were to ask me.",0.7

We drive cars so that the earth can be dangerous. Cars and veicles are to be blamned for earths killer POLUTION. There are some up and downs to faster transportation for example time management we get tomplaces in onethird of the time we would if we would go walking to our destination. We wouldn t be freezing when it s called and sweating when it s hot. The down information is that the government waste a lot of money on gas and car prices even on fast food resturants. The truth is we dont even need cars we WANT cars we don t NEED cars theres a difference of the words and there meanings. For example in the article In Vauban Life Goes On Without Cars"" show that 70 of Paris s families do not own cars and of the, 57 sold their veicle just to move there. When i had a car i was always tense. I m not about this"" said Heidrun Walter a media analyst and a part of cars. Polution...... It kills the earth and infact us aswell very slowly. Each year the government has to waste thousands of dollars to keep producing greenhouses because the use of any type of veicle is monumentous. If we keep doing what we doing there won t be an earth to live on at all. Cars are not the only thing to blame for. we also have a blmame.. When using a veicle is the to to to of gas, which is bad but they still go out and drive for a few hours just wasting there whole and amount of gas. For example 50 of all cars in Europe is half of the people with cars cars...... the the need to develope greenhouses and waste money aswell. If we do every day we we let out into the atmosphere of of fuems that kills the earth and us aswell. Then making the government waste money to create greenhouses to try to at even advance humans lives for a couple more in of years. Up to 50 of carintensive ares in America are to blame for the development of greenhouses stated in the article called In German Suburbs Life Goes On Without Cars.",0.05

e_c5o735ng,0,"Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportation are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner.

It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to fortythousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of vaughn's families do not even own cars, and fiftyseven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. vaughn's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in, Paris bans driving due to smog.

Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths.

In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, rollerskates, skateboards longboards, and penny boards, or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage.

Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in, The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twentythree percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people.

In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.",0.0
e_hruz6crp,-1,"Dear principal,

I have been told to write a paper on whether or not it is fair to allow students that have a B Average just be allowed to play sports. I think that isn't a good decision. Not all people have good grades but are really good at sports. They may be missing out on a good opportunity.

Although the grades do matter in ways.

It can be both good and bad. For example if you avoid all the people below a B Average then there's not going to be much people on one team. Also some people may be very smart and be very good at sports. So that means that you may be missing out on a great opportunity, some people are better then others. You shouldn't always judge a person on their grades.

There is also some good. Most people that are really good at a sport plan on taking it to college. When you go to college you have to have really good grades or else your not going to make the team. Basically all NFL players or any other player had to go to college and make good grades. Also if your a good player and make good grades then that would be 2 times better. So you would probably get more of a better chance to take it big into the real world.

So they should keep in mind that when they feel like fooling around in school and don't feel like doing any work that if they like the sport they play then kiss it goodbye because their not going to go anywhere with those grades. Grades matter so make sure they do their best.",0.0
e_ysia989d,3,"Have you ever thought of joining a Seagoing Cowboys program? I was in one for nine months and it's a great opportunity to help people, animals, and even yourself. You get to see different countries and meet new people. I got to tour around Europe and China. It would be a good experience if your considering going into the military later on or are already there. If your not sure whether you want to join or not let me tell you about my adventure as a seagoing cowboy so maybe that will change your mind.

In August 1945, I received my draft board notice to report. ""You can only go work at the bank?"" said Don Reist, my friend. ""I don't know what to say,"" I responded back. So he told me about this wonderful opportuntiy called being a seagoing cowboy. We were hired to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that where shipped overseas. When we arrived at Greece, Luke Bardawill turned 18 before arriving at New Orleans. After making eight trips, more than any other seagoing cowboy, I had seen many amazing places like Venice Italy with streets of water and China. On our second trip we served as night watchman. My job was checkin all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly reports, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced when i shot feet first towards an opening on side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped me from flying overboard intothe dark Atlantic Ocean. That is why they always warn us to stay alert while watching the cattle. I could have fallen off the boat.

Now you might think its dangerous but really it isn't because we get to take breaks and play games like baseball and volleyball. The most fun activity we did was tabletennis. Being a seagoing cowboy taught me alot. It opened up the world to me. ""It made me aware of peoples needs."" Said Luke. It also helped me realize that life is very important no matter who you are or where you come from. This job has been an unbelievable opportunity to do something special and exciting. If you like to travel then you should definatly try out to become a seagoing cowboy. If your still thinking about doing it remember these words: ""Luke found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also passed the time.",0.9
e_yez6opmy,1,"Dear senator, The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational as Bradford Plumber stated. First of all, The electoral college consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vise President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. We should abolish the electoral college because it is unfair to voters. It's all because of the winnertakeall system that in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is the disaster factor. The state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segragationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to him.

Another issue that most people worry about is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives and the Senate would choose Vise President.

To say the least, abolishing the electoral college is the best idea. According to a gallop poll in 2000, I am not alone. The gallop poll was taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. How does the electoral college even have any defenderes left? Even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism and I couldn't agree more. It is a thing from the past and should stay that way. The electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense because it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Richard A. Posner even says that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.",0.0

e_bncq45oj,4,"I am against driverless cars because they are not safe. I think that we shouldnt have these types of vehicles on the roads. Driverless cars may be dangerous for pedestrians and drivers alike. We also need to consider all the problems that could occur with this type of vehicle. For example, what if there is a malfunction in the car's system while youre driving? It could cause serious injuries or even death. Also some people would prefer having control over their own lives rather than being controlled by technology. Although driverless cars might sound very cool and exciting, it can cause many issues as well. The idea behind these cars seems like an amazing idea but, in reality, it will most likely end up hurting us more than helping us. These cars aren't smart enough yet to drive themselves without assistance from humans. It would take years upon years just trying to perfect one thing about this car such as its brakes, gas pedal, steering wheel etc. So, therefore, I do not support the creation of these ""driverless"" cars.",0.9

e_0a0l51e3,5,"The new technology that can read human emotions is valuable in a classroom setting because it allows us to understand how students are feeling more effectively. As the article explained, this technology can detect other people's emotions, even if they are not explicitly expressed. For instance, from the text, a person is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Technology is becoming increasingly important in our lives and makes our works and studies easier. From the article, Huang predicts that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This technology can help teachers modify their lessons, just like an effective human instructor. It also allows people to relax after working or studying, as we use technology to play games or watch videos to help us unwind.

Furthermore, this technology can be used to make computeranimated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So, computers need to understand that as well. Your home PC may not be able to handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile, but it shows how much technology can do.

To reproduce emotions on stage, a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning. Empathy, or feeling someone else's emotional state, may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Putting on a happy face actually works, as an effective drama coach would attest.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read emotional expressions in a classroom is valuable because it allows us to understand students' feelings more effectively, helping teachers modify their lessons and create a more engaging learning environment. It also makes our lives easier and more enjoyable by providing us with entertainment and relaxation.",0.9
e_04euimi3,6,"The article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a very interesting topic to read because of it's similar features to earth. This planet is also called the ""Evening Star.'' it is one of the brightest point of light in the sky making it simple for even an imagreasant spot for a stargazer to spot. They may have thought that venus was once covered largely with oceans like the earth, but now this is only a couple of decades away. We need to know more about the planets and what their future may hold. Venus has an atmosphere of 90% carbon dioxide blanket over it. NASA is also experimenting with different types of technology. In the passage the author says the technology has lasted for more than two weeks.

Venus is actually the second planet closer to us and could have once been cover in oceans. The climate of the planet is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it is even more intense then the air pressure that we have on Earth. On the other hand venus would need to be able to hold that pressure and heat just like earth does. They would have to be more careful and prepared if they are stuck in the hot planet. They may not be able to go through all the dangers on the planet and still make it safer to travel up in space and be prepared to take samples of rock, gas, and other things. It would be nice to know that NASA is willing to send more people to Venus but it is not a difficult planet to study.",0.7
e_big3qk1f,6,"The author supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying how it's our nearest planet to earth and also because of it's similarities with Earth. The text says ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" which shows how it could be related to us in many ways. In addition to this, the author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike plantet in our solar system"". This statement tells readers that they should study Venus more often than other planets.

One reason why we should study Venus even more because as the article said 'scientists believe that long ago Venus was probably coverd largely with Oceans and could support various forms of life'. It goes on to say 'long agaon Venus was probbaly covered largely with Ocens and coudl have supprted various forms of life just like here at home'. This means that there might have been some sort of form of life living or existing on Venus millions of years ago. But then things started changing due to the pressure, heat and the erupting volcanos. Nowadays Venus has no body of water on its surface anymore. That can tell us so much about what kind of environment it had back then before all these changes happened. There's still a chance for NASA to send people up there to explore everything else that happens on Venus today, but it will be very dangerous considering how hot the temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit and how much pressure there would be 90 times greater than what we experience on earth.

Another reasin why scientists want to know more about Venus is becuase it may have been the most Earthlike planet in our Solar System. We know for sure that Mars is the closest thing to look like Earth, but Venus may have actually been like Earth. They both share same size density and distance from the sun as well. It would mean that there were many years where Venus was closer to us than it is now. What the text stated was 'since Venus is sometimes right around the cornerin space termshumnaans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this clouddraped world'. This is something that NASA wants to find out too. They want to figure out if Venus ever looked like Earth did when it was first created thousands of years ago. If one day humans get the opportunity to go to Venus, they will definitely try to see how the place looks like. Scientist might find something new that hasn't been discovered yet.

These are only two reasons why the author believes that studying Venus would be beneficial and valuable. Astronomers will continue to learn more things about Venus so that someday maybe humans could visit Venus in the future. Studying Venus is worth pursuing despite the dangers it presents by learning about how Venus use to look like and how the weather conditions were back then, long time ago. People will never stop trying to discover the unknown because their goal is to find something bigger and better.",0.9

Congestion, the amount of car traffic in a specific area, is significantly decreasing due to a new idea that has sprung:limiting car usage. Places such as Vauban, Paris, Bogota, Cali and Valledupar are participating in a program that's made to decrease car usage. Some of these cities enjoy Day Without Cars, a holiday that ""promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog"". Selsky 1 Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Limiting car usage promotes a healthier, cleaner environment for all. By using alternative transportation, such as buses, taxis, biking or even walking, the amount of greenhouse emission is drastically reduced. Rosenthal 1 The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States are encouraging ""car reduced"" communites, causing legislators to act. This will cut the amount of money spent yearly by U.S. citizens and the government as a whole, reducing the federal transportation bill. Rosenthal 1

Paris, too, momentarily banned driving due to smog. Paris enforced a driving ban that lasted a few days to clear the city's air after a close call to record pollution. Although some people were upset, congestion was down 60 percent, and the smog cleared a few days later. Duffer 1 All in all, diesel usage decreased, leaving a ""greener"" environment in its place.

President Obama has also wanted ""to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions,"" Rosenthal 1, he revealed last week. Although the United States' rate of car ownership per person and per household has started to decrease, there are still more things that could be done to create a longterm cultural shift. Rosenthal 1 New York has recently created a bikesharing program that has done remarkably well. Many cities have proposed plans to make personal vehicle ownership impractical or undesirable. Rosenthal 1 Even Bill Ford, the owner of the Ford Car Company, suggested an idea to creat cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" at the Mobile World Congress last year. Rosenthal 1

Bogota, Colombia specifically enjoys a yearly carfree day in which the only exception of vehicle transportation are buses and taxis. This prevents traffic jams, reduces air pollution, and cuts the many costs to cars. Even in rain, the event continued on ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Antanas Mockus, the Bogota Mayor. Selsky 1

Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asucnion, Paraguay, said that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" Smog reduction, costcutting, stressrelieving and trafficjamfree, participating in this global change is an opportunity you won't want to miss.",0.0

e_gsie8r4t,-1,"I think students will benefit from being able to attend classes at home. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for studentsto attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing. I don't believe that all students should take online courses because, some people learn better in a classroom setting than they do through an electronic device. However, there are many reasons why this could be beneficial to our youth today. Students would have the opportunity to work at their own pace without stressing out about getting everything done on time, having someone come and help them one onone if needed, and lastlyit can prevent bullying from taking place at school. These three main points can really open up new doors for kids who struggle with attending publicschools but still want to receive their diploma.

Students working at their own pace has always been my favorite part about homeschooling. My sister is currently going to high school right nowand she told me how much she misses it when we were homeschooled together. She feels like she doesn't get enough sleep because she spends so long in each class trying to catch up on what everyone else already knows. If you give her more time to complete assignments then she wouldn't feel like she was running behind schedule. You also wouldn't see students crying over not finishing their homework on time either because they have a different teacher everyday and they didn't know what they were supposed to write down. This gives students the freedom to actually have fun during the day instead of worrying about getting their assignment finished on time. It helps reduce stress levels which means a happier healthier child!

Another reason why I think students would enjoy online school is because they can have one on one help whenever needed. A lot of students suffer from ADDADHD or they just need extra help understanding certain things in class. When you are in a big room filled with 30 other kids your chances of getting the help you need becomes very slim. With online schooling you can easily reach out to whomever is helping you and they won't have another hundred people asking them questions too. They will be able to focus only on you and make sure you understand what needs to be learned before moving onto something else. This is the best choice for anyone who struggles to learn information quickly and wants to excel in whatever field of study they choose.

Lastly, online school can prevent bullying from happening at any point in time. It is easy to avoid anyone you don't want to speak to anymore. All you got to do is block them on social media and cut off communication. In school this isn't possiblebecause you have to deal with them every single day until graduation. Bullying effects most peoples lives no matter if its physical or verbal. Sometimes it may even lead to depression and suicide. There are too many risks involved with sending children to school these days so why not try something completely new? Online schooling offers safety and comfortabilityfor students who aren't ready to go back into society yet.

In conclusion, students who decide to attend their classes from home would find it easier to keep up with their grades. Not only do they have the ability to work at their own pace without feeling rushed but they also have access to tutoring anytime they ask for it. Lastly, since they aren't around other people face to face they wont have to worry about being bullied by anyone.",0.9

But she didn t feel embarrassed she was doing this for her husband and two daughters who were watching the broadcast back home in Newark. The European had a the tradition of the to as an young team. After all when Trisha had demonstrated her strokes in front of the Olympic Committee they praised her solid technique feeling that she would be the perfect example of the average swimmer to juxtapose against the elite athletes.

Trisha focused on putting one arm in front of another breathing bilaterally but already from the corner of her goggles she could see the others overtaking her with torpedolike speed.

e_0i492e52,5,"This new technology to read people's emotions is a good idea because it will be able to help teachers figure out if their students are bored or confused. The Facial Action Coding System can also tell when you're lying, so that could also come in handy with helping detectives solve cases they couldn't have solved before by using this device.

The first reason why this would be useful for reading peoples emotions is that it could help detect whether the person has become bored while learning. It says in paragraph 6 that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This means that the device could see how someone feels about something and change what they're doing based on the emotion of the subject they were working on. In my opinion I think that this would be a great way to make sure kids aren't struggling through work they don't understand just because they're too embarrassed to ask for help.

Another thing that this machine could do is determine if someone was lying or not. Paragraph 8 states that ""To an expert, faces don't lie these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" If we had this technology at our disposal then I feel like it would benefit everyone. For example say there was some sort of incident where someone died but the suspect said he didn't know anything about it. With this device we could simply put them into a room alone, then turn on the camera on the computer and see if they were actually telling the truth about having nothing to do with whatever happened, or if they really did it. That could help us find out who did it and stop any more harm from coming to anyone else.

Therefore, I believe that the Facial Acting Coding System should be brought into schools around America and all over the world. We need this type of equipment because it could save countless lives if we use it correctly. It could save many innocent children from the hands of dangerous criminals, as well as adults. When we start using this kind of technology it becomes easier to catch those who break laws and hurt other people. Then once we arrest those individuals and get rid of the threats in society we can continue using these devices to protect ourselves even better than ever.",0.9

e_y9gmt9ap,0,"People use them to commute around various locations and it releases harmful emissions. The object that is being referred to is a car, a car is beneficial but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere and it is not as bad as it seems to not use a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend.

Cars release green house gas emissions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. that is a main cause as to why people shoul limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article Paris bans driving due to smog. This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. it also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. in paragraph 5 of the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

it is explaining that automobiles are a big part of the suburbs and is a affect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house emissions of cars. its states in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house emissions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the use of automobiles the numbers can be cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as atated in the article Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can be reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.

limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way,"" said a media trainer and a mother of two whos statement is said in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, experince a fortuitous life style. "" Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a move,ent called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

this shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world are also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogotoa, Columbia a buisness man named Carlos Arturo said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota thsi shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benifiet the individual. 'If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment."" as explained in the article The End Of Car Culture.

this is relatin to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. which as result of that ocurring has benifited or will benifiet the enviroment. This shows how more and more peole are traveling less by car.

The advantages of limiting car use far outway the disadvantages of not using a car. this means that people are duing more to commute less by car and more by eco friendly transportation like bikes.

If it were a popular vote it would be equal to everyone and not just some random person in the U.S.. If the Electoral College vote was to be changed, then the United States of America would still not have a president because of it's unfairness.

The Electoral College can be very helpful to our country's people in many ways such as allowing the people to freely vote for themselves, equal rights, and equality.

e_fm9kxinm,1,"Dear Snator,

I would like to express my strong belief that the electoral voting system, which currently deterines how we choose the President of the United States, should not be abolished. While it is true that this system is not a direct popular vote, and the electors themselves do not actually vote for the candidate they are pledged to support, there are several practical reasons why we should keep the Electoral College.

First and foremost, the electoral voting system provides certainty of outcome. Though a dispute over the electoral vote is possible, it is less liely than one over a popular vote. The reason for this is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. When you vote for a presidential candidate, you are actually voting for a slate of electors loyal to that candidate. With most states awarding electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even numbr, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has transregional appeal. No region, such as the South or the Northeast, has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. Therefore, a solid regional favorite, like Romney in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states where they will not gain any electoral votes. This is a desirable outcome because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are more likely to feel disenfranchised if they do not believe their president truly represents their interests.

The third reason to keep the Electoral College is the tactic it induced toward tossup states. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes forces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. Elections in these states are closely contested, and voters pay close attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful and informed on the issues at hand. The thoughtful voters in tossup states are the most likely to make the decision on who will become the next president.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012, but Obama, who won that vote, received 29 electoral votes. In cntrast, a victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. Thus, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, forcing runoff elections. This problem is less pressing because the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner.

Some argue that the electoral voting system turns off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, believing that their vote will not make a difference. However, it is importnt to remember that no voter's vote directly swings a national election, yet in 2012, about half of eligible Americans still voted. Voters in presidential elections are typically people who want to express a political preference rather than people concerned about a potential deciding vote.

In conclusion, Senator, I firmly believe that the benefits of the Eletoral College outweigh its perceived disadvantages. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures a presidential candidate with transregional appeal, focuses campaigns on important swing states, restores weight to large states, and avoids the problem of elections with no clear majority. I urge you to consider these points when discussing the future of our electral process.",0.9
e_jqkzd0pr,-3,"But their integration in the automobiles is a cause of a controversy that separates the technical and the precautionary. In this age of the Internet, cell phones have no doubt changed the way we learn, work, and communicate with one another. It is also scientifically proven that the use of mobile phones while driving is a cause of accidents. Moreover, the use of digital devices while driving, and especially mobile phones, has become a major danger to the security of the world's roads. For example, drivers using cell phones put themselves at greater risk of causing serious and sometimes deadly accidents, because their reactions are slower, their driving skills are reduced, their vigilance is impaired and their field of vision is reduced. Driving a car while using a cell phone requires divided attention and increased mental stress. When the maximum attention of the driver is argued from the individual's responsibility, enterprises with the rule of immediate consequence for threatening distraction would not only be able to collect a feedback from their machines, but also apply it to the reality of the selfcontrol goals of the otherwise immovable driver's culture. While the arguments based on the security of mobile phones are apparently applicable in a large number of cases, experts say that they do not deduce from the possible mental and physical dangers of using these devices. As a matter of fact, technological developments have already contributed to effective and safe automatic mechanisms, such as proximity sensors that in real time and in the event of an emergency warn the driver of the dangers of using mobile devices, enabling the automobile to make security adjustments to the strategy, using genuine gps systems that are outside and disconnected from all additional digital interference. Furthermore, the handsfree devices' purpose is that the statistical difference between the distracted drivers using the handsfree devices and those using mobile phones seems to be negligible it seems that both distracted drivers have the same predisposition to react to any danger threatening, unresisted, based on the untethered device, which would make the device even more dangerous. In conclusion, safer cell phone use can noticeably reduce the risk of collisions due to avoiding distraction, through the use of installed randomeffect based, displacementinvariant feedback that triggers technological indicators of good practices, limiting the bad, but more preferably in the acceptable range. Becoming a responsible roaduser, it will probably immerse itself in coping strategies that adapt to the consciousness of consciousness, which combines existing laws that prohibit the use of mobile devices to certain potential possibilities regarding the foreseeable future. The solution is to support the elements that offer the prospects of expansion to greater driving distances for companies and their workers  all this in accordance with legal requirements, a noble contribution to the observance of the state's security goals. We should first and foremost focus on the road and keep the distanceisolating methods within reach.",1.0

Another problem that Venus has is the atmospheric pressure and pressure of almost 97 percent. It is also dangerous to breathe on Venus. Even thought the temperature of this planet still is near that of sea level on the Earth, Venus still has a largely carbon dioxide atmosphere. On top of the fact that this surface is so close to the planet's heat, the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth.

In Paragraph 5, the author gives an idea for NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. In Paragraph 2, the author states that scientists want to know what they are doing and how we can use it. This is a good thing, but this argument isn't supported. The idea of trying to study Venus is that ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus,"" stating that NASA has been studying this planet for years now, and explains that if they do end the mission, ""astronomers should look back at this time period to see what it's like.""

The author, however, does not give evidence as to why this idea should be pursued.. It is also argued that Venus has the potential to be the most Earthlike planet in the solar system. This idea was mentioned earlier in paragragh 2 that the author says, ""... because of Venus's proximity to us, it would be nice to see if we could actually make it work.""

In conclusion, the possibties of carrying out research in Venus still have to be considered. Even if scientists are not satisfied with the idea, they should still pursue this planet. They should not be able to make a claim that no matter how great the dangers are, it is important to learn more of the other planets and understand the similarities between them.",0.7

Every state has its own number of electoral college memebers thats based on thier population. If you win the election you win the statewide electoral vote to.

e_pqkn6mmt,-1,"Many people feel the need to check their cellular device while behind the wheel of a vehicle. Although many people own and operate cellphones on a daily basis, they shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle because it is a hazard for everyone. To begin with, it causes a distraction to those driving and others who are also on the road. If any lights come on for notifications, others may stray their eyes to see what is flashing in their mirrors or next to them which could cause an accident to occur on the roadway. Everyone needs to stay focused on where they're driving so no mishaps occur. Even if there is a stop in traffic, people need to be wary of their surroundings since it could start moving at any time. Everyone nowadays is curious about their phones, almost everyone always has a cellular device on them which causes a ""need"" to be pay so much attention to their pockets. Although many may want to have their phones on hand, it isn't a necessity for anyone. Additionally, most people should stay off their phones because it is a hazardous situation in general. For example, people tend to crash into others when they are too attentive to their cellular device. If one is not careful, an accident on the road is waiting to occur and it could be just around the corner. Although plenty of people may say that it is important to check for work or some other related or unrelated topic, the other person should understand that it would be illegal and unsafe to check the phone while driving. In conclusion, it is unnecessary for people to check their cellular devices while driving because it is not very safe and could cause accidents on the road.",0.0

e_67s0vm3g,-9,"First of all, if I were a NASA scientist to speak with the others of Tge Face on Mars, I would say that it had not been made by the aliens.They were there to make a face on Mars. In the second place, I would not believe in theory because there is nothing to demonstrate that the aliens have made a face on Mars.Terzo, I would not believe in theory because the image seems a face becauseof light and that's what I think.

I would not believe in this theory because there is nothing to demonstrate that the aliens have made their face on Mars. It is all just a joke for people to make fun of. Even just a big lie to show that aliens are real.

I would not believe in theory because there is no evidence that the aliens have made a face on Mars because there is no evidence that the aliens are real.

The image also looks like a face because of the light that the camera has taken hold. The image also shows a face because of what the camera is trying to do the image.

I don't think this theory because I don't think the aliens have made a face on Mars. The reason why I think, since there is no proof that it was made by the aliens. There is nothing to demonstrate that they made itOn Mars, there is only the test that was made by aliens if there is evidence to prove it and if they did not lie to me. There are also evidence that it was not a face and that it was only the camera that made it a face.",1.0
e_0ev0m6lc,0,"Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment. For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will receive a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.",0.0
e_c82x6nh8,4,"Driverless cars will aftey the world. Many cars have been on the road as of right now, but there are too many problems with the cars. There are a lot of negative things about diverless cars.

It would be more expensive to fix the roads then if the drivers had to be on the phone to tell the car to take over. It is said that the car may not be reliable enough. In Paragragh number 2 it says that if it was in a accident that could happen to someone, who was at fault, the driver? The car could start out in the drivers hand and then turn into someone else's car instead of the average person.

If the car does not need the driver to be notified when they are going to do something on the road it would need alot of help to get in and out of the way. I belive that the average person is capable of driving independently. In paragraphgragh number 6 it states that heshe would have to do alot of things themselves in order for the car to get to where its needed to go. But it may take more than one person to buy it, because there would be more things on the road. If someone were able to afford the diverless car what about the people who do not? Would they even be aware of how to drive it if it did not need them in any way?

Another opnion the driverless car has is that the car is to expensive to be practical. A lot of people would be interested in the diverless car but they would have to pay more money for it and fix it as well. In paragragh number 1 it explains that ""It can drive on its own, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""

Finally in order to get to the driverless car you would need to be physically present in the car to ensure you are safe while on the road. If the kids do not have any information about the vehicle then why are they not in complete control of it? It would make them do things for the car like remeber a time wasting. It'd also take ages and it would get out of hand causing people to not pay attention to the road.

In conclusion, I If the technology to make a driverless car work, is not going to be the best suited for peoples needs. Not only will it cost to much money but it will also be really expensive. Driverless cars would benifit everyone no matter what the laws are for if they ever needed them in the first place.",0.7

e_t69i99pi,-7,Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face s depending on how the person look with no smile no anger and no saddness. The more that is nonverbal showing the more we we look though our face s. Smile are all differnet depending if it s a real one or a forced one. Faces don t lie Smiling don t be truthful or emotions. Willing a look on the face it can be a in the time but it is a a.. it tells us how you is feeling today or what they are is time. When actors fake a smile or a frown they don t feel it really they just make the face to prove or hide what they are feeling or showing. They act the show and give what s on the paper and have the same movement that we humans have to use when we express how we feel. We have six basic emotions. Happiness surprise anger disgust fear and there is sadness. They associated with each of our characteristics movements of the facial muscules. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. We have some software tracks on these facial movement that our brain follows it can find out you re mix emotion and expression by you re neutral face. This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness. This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute but not what they are feeling right after or before. What I m tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won t see what s really happening our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know s what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife. It s different how the Da Vinci code is with converting their specific emotoin with the new electronic code.,0.05
e_1tnbpou6,-6,"Introduction Driverless cars the cars that was once considered a luxury of our world are now becoming a reality. The technology of driverless cars have been the topic of much debate with the technology that would will revolutionize the way we travel but opponents that these it will have negative problems. In this essay I will argue in favor of the development of driverless cars using details from the article Driverless Cars are Coming to support my position. Body One of the main advantages of driverless cars is increased safety. According to the article driverless cars have the potential to reduce accidents by 90 saving thousands of lives each year. This is because driverless cars are equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms that help them to take less hazards and accidents more than driverless cars. Additionally driverless cars are not subject to less error such such drunk driving or or or accidents. Another benefit ofless cars is increased accidents to of driving and disabled. The article states that driverless cars can provide independence for people who are unable to go to to to have more fulfilling lives. Moreover driverless driverless cars will cause of accidents and parking problems as they could be allowed to go off and and then continue on to another day. Furthermore driverless car are better for many world. The article mentions that driverless cars can reduce fuel consumption by much. and can become programmed to take more less routes and more money. Additionally driverless cars could also encourage the use of electric vehicles which would further reduce carbon emissions. However opponents of driverless cars argue that they will lead to job loss and decreased privacy. The article acknowledges that driverless cars could displace certain jobs such as truck drivers and taxi drivers. However it also suggests that new jobs will be created in fields such as programming and maintenance. Moreover the article states that driverless cars can be designed with privacy in mind such as using encrypted data and protecting passenger information. Conclusion In conclusion the development of driverless cars has both positive and negative aspects. However i believe the The benefits of driverless cars outweigh the idea. Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel increasing safety mobility and sustainability. While there are concerns about job and, but these can be addressed with the technology and design. Ultimately the development of driverless cars is a step towards a better future and I am excited to see the impact it will have on our society.",0.95
e_vstmjor1,2,"A landform is a natural occurence and can be found anywhere. A landform is not created by anything, it just simply happens. In the case of ""the face"", it's no different than other landforms that have been seen elsewhere in the world or even elsewhere in space. The face was caused naturally. The evidence to support this claim will come from what NASA has said about the discovery, the facts about the picture itself, and why the conspiracy theories are false.

When NASA first announced the finding of the face on Mars, they stated it as another natural occurrence like many others. They didn't try to make more out of the situation than what was there. If there were any unusual objects around the area where the face was located, NASA would likely say something along those lines but they didnt. Therefore we know that the face was nothing special. We can also learn from the facts that were released about the image.

NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft captured the photo on April 5th 1976 when the ship got close enough for clear pictures. While this sighting was odd at first glance, upon further inspection, scientists realized that it was only a mesa. These structures are very common around Cydonia. Jim Garvin says that it reminded him of Middle Butte in Idaho, a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa which is the same height as the mysterious one on Mars. This comparison gives us evidence that the face is merely a strange looking natural formation. It may look interesting, but it does not have a lifeform making it up.

There still could be people living on mars though right? Well if you ask most sane individuals, they'll tell you that it isn't possible, however some might disagree. Those who believe that aliens live on Mars use the fact that NASA wouldn't want to admit the truth because their budget depends on getting information from places such as Mars. That reasoning seems rather unfounded however since if the public believed that these creatures actually existed, then NASA would get more money instead of less due to the popularity boost. Another reason for believing that there is alien life on Mars is that the photos weren't taken with the best quality. Although it is true that the image wasn's perfect, every other detail aligns with the idea that this was a natural formation. Also if someone really wanted to find evidence of life, all they'd have to do is take better pictures, which NASA would be willing to do. So again we see that the conspiracies are illogical.

In conclusion we can understand that the face is simply a landform based off of how scientists describe it, the facts presented by them, and the logic behind the conspiracy theory claims. As time goes on it becomes more unlikely that there will ever be proof of alien life existing in our solar system so we must accept what the professionals say until further notice. Until new evidence proves otherwise, we should conclude that the face on Mars is a natural landform.",0.9

e_tkz2ejeq,-2,"Theodor Adornos concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and the products capitalism produces in the cultural sphere to enhance the existing social practices that benefit the further development of capitalism. Therefore, Adorno suggested that most media products, such as films, books, television programs, reinforce the populations belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society.
In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as films and books, where wealth is often associated with happiness. However, another example with a more apparent connection to reinforcing capitalism is entertainment for children. From a very young age, modern children are exposed to different sorts of media in the form of tv shows, cartoons, and animated films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the childrens entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern childrens entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks Clement, 2018. Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films characters to ensure financial benefit.",0.0

This is also a stupid idea because sports are suppose to be fun and its a privilege to play sports . You should not make it a B or A point average because a C is not bad. Your not failing or about to fail so there's no point. You should base it on how they do in class and how they act up. you should also see if they act up during the program. You should not look at their grades if they are higher than a C because that person could be gone for along time or the teacher will be gone for alone time. So that makes your your grade go down or stay there, it wouldn't go up.

e_a24v9mmd,-8,"Venus, or evening star, is one of the most stunning and sophisticated plants we have in the solors system. Reaeon why it is fabulous and complex is due to how tightly density and size and time from the closest to the sun and distance, Earth, VenusAnd to Mars, which makes a challenging place to explore even more.

The reason Venus is such a threat to continue learning closer to learning is hot that it is.Atomphere is about 97% thick, making Cardon dioxide coating in Venus, 90 times larger than what people experience, as it reads the passage3. Another reason why this challenge is the highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in the atomosphere of Venus, which is a Venus atomospheric type of acid that is very harmful.However, overall temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.The Vehen Terries or surface are like volcanoeruption to the probes that are searched by the author in Section 3

e_lvknugpu,-3,"Introduction: The increased release of greenhouse gases from human industry and transportation has intensified climate change and threatens the lives and cultures of many peoples on earth. The shift must now take place and it must be toward the study of transportation and its less harmful side, as a viable solution. The future vision of automobile genius Mr. William Ford and the general pros and cons of utilitarian international transportation alternatives illustrate real possible worldview changes. In this article an exemplary analysis has been derived from the perspectives of the environment, society and economy. Investigations and discussions: Travel is the most essential aspect of communication allowing human presence among the people. Roads, railways, automobiles, airplanes and motorcycles provide the convenience of modern life. And a real evaluation of the combustion methods such as my own daily transport services is my personal assurance to act in a responsible way and contribute to the cause of a more sustainable world in the future. Even so, this ease of travel has changed the environment of a sustainable world to a state of crisis that cannot be avoided. Los Angeles smog, a corrosive Mexican megatorropolis, a skyhigh Philadelphia skyline, all result from unwise transport services. And, in turn, this has fueled a movement toward globalization. Analyzing the environment and social developments, one can see that these facts together could not be dismissed as random coincidences, that many of the households with cars and most of them are, in fact, family households, or at least that's how they are generally understood, have no rudimentary alternative, and thus cannot have any of the normal restrictions that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unavoidable repercussions: the abolition of public transportation services, especially for the transportation of people, must come. Whether this can be done in a sustainable way, is a difficult question. The recomendation presented in the following text is a very specific ephemeral proposal, which is to be seen as a personal automobile that feels the repercussions of a time that will be very wonderful, when cities will rise and merge and people will lift themselves up with the help of the miraculous time machines. Wull is is residerting in teh power of th tast, which, along with the transportation of automobiles, will soon require the decongestion of the human brain, and the olfactory efficiency of the horible, incommendable awnawance of this phenomenon is a given.",1.0
e_4rt0dtwh,4,"In my opinion i believe that driverless cars wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. i believe this because they wouldnt know when to stop, they might go out of control, and it wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions.

First I believ that they wouldnt know when to stop. For example, if a car was being driven by the human what would they do when they swerve or stop? i dont think they should do it because they might get into an accident and it wont be safer for the other person to indeflict stiutions.

Second reason is, they might not be very reliable during deflict stiutions. For Example, if there was a car accident on the highway and the car goes out of control, you wouldnt be able to see what could happen or who is fault. Its hard to know when these cars are going to indeflict stiutions. This means that they could crash and kill someone or even hurt another person or get injured or injured.

My last reason is they wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions. They wouldn't be as surportive if the car was to go out of control. They would be very risky and would probably crash into something. i believe this because it wont stop them from doing what they want.

In conclusion i think Driverless Cars are not safe and shouldnt be driven by humans. The reason is they wouldnt know when to stop, the car might be effected by something and it could get someone hurt, and they would never get sued because it wasnt safe.",0.7
e_gug4titc,5,"As an 8th grader, I have noticed that people's impressions of others can change drastically based on various factors. For instance, someone's attitude, emotions, and expressions can greatly impact how others perceive them. For example, if someone is always smiling and friendly, they are more likely to be seen as approachable and kind, whereas if they are always grumpy and negative, they may be seen as unpleasant to be around.

I have also noticed that people's impressions of others can be influenced by their upbringing and environment. For example, if a person grows up in a wealthy family, they may be more likely to have a positive impression of wealth and material possessions, whereas if they grow up in a poor family, they may have a more negative view of these things. Similarly, if a person is exposed to a lot of violence or negativity in their environment, they may develop a more pessimistic outlook on life.

However, it is important to note that people's impressions of others can also be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. For example, if someone has a preconceived notion about a particular group of people, they may be more likely to form an impression based on that bias rather than the actual person's behavior or character.

So, how can people change their impressions of others? One strategy is to actively seek out new experiences and perspectives. By exposing oneself to different cultures, beliefs, and ways of life, a person can broaden their understanding and form more informed impressions. Additionally, practicing empathy and active listening can help a person better understand the perspectives of others and form more positive impressions.

Another important factor is the role of parents in shaping a person's impressions of others. Parents can influence their child's impressions by modeling positive behaviors and attitudes, such as being kind and respectful towards others. They can also teach their child to be openminded and to avoid making judgments based on superficial characteristics.

Finally, it is worth considering the impact of the economy on people's impressions. In times of economic hardship, people may be more likely to form negative impressions of others based on their financial situation.",1.0

e_k0vkrz1l,-7,Dear Principle I believe that only students to participate in sports without a high average is a good idea. Students aciive in sports generally don t have much time for otudying and homework because they are so occupied in their sport and are too busy with practices. If a student has a B average in school then they most likely are a hardworking student that believes eheir gradei are very important. If they have a lower grade average then ie is possible that the otudent will slip farther behind in class and have assignments piled up. Students that participate in sports have practices very frequently and usually after school. If a student is working on sports and practicing so hard and so much they will not have much time for homework. If they start to fall behind on homework ehey don t finish it or they get points taken off or they don t learn anything from a class discussion that refers to the homework. If a student has a B average in school they are generally a hard worker and will find a way to juggle both school and sports and wont slip behind as quickly and they might if they had a C average and were already having a hard time understanding some concepts in the curriculum. Students in sports get home after practice exhausted and will most likely need to rest afterwards creating a smaller gap of time for homework and studying. After having a C average saudent will be at his own or class and probably need to figure it oue firsi. If they start getting trouble the way with aheir homework and it will take them more time to get it complete then they wial get frustrated and get up not doing. A B average student would reot up quickly and work hard on their homework to make up for the time they missed while at practice and not stop until it is completely finished then check their answers and the next day will eagerly engage in the discussion on it A 3 average student will take notes in class and work hard on homework when they is. they might seack off in school and not try as hard in school as well time. With iports concerned the C average student will begin slacking off more and falling behind and will only be able to think about their next practice concentrating on only sports. A B average student will focus on school very hard to keep their grades up so they can continue to be in iports. A rule that only B average saudents or higher can play in sports wile be good for the students who work hard and might encourage students to keep their grades up so they too could be in sports and could easily boost the schools grade average and help kidi aearn better.,0.05
e_ywbyyp2u,-2,"The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has long been a prevalent issue in our society. While progress has been made to depict diverse perspectives and narratives, there is still a long way to go. This perpetuation of whiteness as the norm has had a significant impact on perceptions of race and identity, leading to a skewed understanding and unequal representation. In exploring this issue, it can be useful to examine the film ""Get Out"" and other notable works that shed light on this phenomenon.
""Get Out,"" directed by Jordan Peele, is a groundbreaking horror film that delves into the experience of being a Black man in America. The story follows Chris Washington, an AfricanAmerican man, as he visits the home of his white girlfriend's family. The film deftly explores the systemic racism and subtle microaggressions faced by people of color in predominantly white spaces. By presenting an AfricanAmerican perspective in a genre typically dominated by white narratives, ""Get Out"" challenges the default portrayal of whiteness in cinema.
One of the most striking portrayals in the film is the character of Rose Armitage, Chris's girlfriend. Rose initially presents herself as a wellmeaning, liberal white woman who is empathetic towards racial issues. However, as the narrative progresses, it becomes evident that her intentions are sinister. This portrayal challenges the common stereotype of white saviors and allies, who are often positioned as the moral compasses in stories involving people of color. By subverting this trope, ""Get Out"" highlights the dangers of assuming wellintentioned whiteness.
Another film that sheds light on the issue of whiteness as the default is ""The Dark Knight."" Although not explicitly about race, the way it handles Harvey Dent's character is telling. Harvey Dent, a white man, is portrayed as a public hero, his downfall serving as a significant plot point. Meanwhile, the character of Lucius Fox, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is left to be the voice of reason and moral guidance in the background. This subtle portrayal reinforces the notion that authority and heroism are inherently tied to whiteness, while people of color are relegated to supporting roles.
Moreover, the portrayal of whiteness as the default in media extends beyond casting choices and characters. It encompasses the broader narratives and storylines that are predominantly centered around white perspectives. For instance, in romantic comedies, the primary love stories usually revolve around white characters. The romantic relationships between people of color are often sidelined as secondary or exoticized. This perpetuates the idea that love and romance are primarily the domain of white individuals, marginalizing other racial identities.
The impact of such skewed representations cannot be overstated. They create and reinforce a hierarchy based on race, where whiteness is seen as the gold standard of beauty, success, and normalcy. This has severe consequences for people of color, who often internalize these distorted perceptions, leading to feelings of inferiority and inadequacy. Additionally, the limited representation of diverse backgrounds perpetuates stereotypes, misunderstandings, and even racism, as audiences are not exposed to a wide range of perspectives and experiences.
However, it is crucial to acknowledge that progress has been made in recent years. Films like ""Moonlight"" and ""Black Panther"" have shattered records and won critical acclaim, demonstrating the demand for diverse narratives. These films offer nuanced portrayals of Black stories and identities, challenging the preconceived notions of whiteness as the default. Further, initiatives like the ""OscarsSoWhite"" movement have shed light on the lack of diversity in Hollywood, resulting in increased discussions surrounding representation and inclusion.
In conclusion, the portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has had a significant impact on perceptions of race and identity. The tendency to center narratives around white characters, as well as the limited representation of diverse backgrounds, perpetuates existing inequalities and reinforces harmful stereotypes. However, recent works such as ""Get Out"" and ""Moonlight"" have paved the way for more inclusive storytelling, sparking conversations about representation. It is imperative for filmmakers, audiences, and industry gatekeepers to continue challenging the default narrative of whiteness, to create a more equitable and diverse media landscape.",1.0

Essay:

In ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke did join, signed up or participeted the Seagoing Cowboy job. It was realy a very hard work job, he work so hard and long, that job was not for faint hearts. In addition he did make nine long trips to help many countries in Europe and china, that job was not for faint hearts. But he got more than what was expected for him from that journey, that job changed Lukes perspective and his outlook. I think, everyone should have an opporunity to be part and do that job atleast once, here's why!


Firstly, Luke had worked for long hours everyday, in the article we can read Luke ""cared for the animals"" onboard for ""two and three times in a day, ""he had pulled up bags of hay and ""clean the stalls"" in ""all day"". This made him a very strong and determined person, because Luke had a very strong ""physical"" conditioning and endurance. This made him ready to take up and overcome many hardships and challenges ahead for rest of his life, because Luke learned from that ""Seagoing Cowboy"" job he did how to stay ""fits and ready"" to take up and overcome many hardship and ""physical "" challenges in front him for rest of his lives, so we should participate and get that job atleast one, because ""it make and get your strong physical condition and ready to takeup and over overcome challenges.



Further, ""Seagoing Cowboys "" job helped him get more awareness and a very different and better ""global"" awareness and his knowledge on people of other countries increased because ""this "" Seagoing Cowboy "" job was not about "" just "" a job to ""help and serve people "" this job had a very deeper and important impact for everyone in ""Luke's "" life and for rest of everyone in life who did take that job and get more awareness and a very deeper understanding of ""cultures "" of different and foreign ""countries "" for rest of everyone's lives. It also ""enriched and educated "" their knowledge of many things in life and gave ""culture and education "". ""That "" job was very ""valuable"" and important one. So everyone must take part, to "" Seagoing Cowboy ""job because of the awareness you gain and for rest of lives and get more enrich and valuable culture knowledge of "" foreign countries "" in the World, this job was ""important "" one! So everyone must take part, to ""Seagoing Cowboy"" job for rest of lives and get more valuable and rich cultured knowledge of "" Foreign countries"" in this whole ""World"".",1.0
e_wpuddw63,2,"The Face on Mars. Many say tis is evidence of alien life. But is it really, or is it just a landform that just happened to look like a human face? I will show you the proof that it is, in fact, a landform.

The first reason the Face is just a landform is that, there isn't any real evidence that there is life on Mars. There are no pictures or proof, just the assumption that there is. They may assume it's alien life, but it's still just a guess. They have no proof. In paragraph 14, it says, ""But what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West"" This proves in paragraph 14 that they are just guessing.

The second reason I say the Face is just a landform is because, it says in paragraph 11, ""MGS Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" So this shows that the picture and the ""face"" were just a guess, because they needed to take a second picture to see if it really was a face, and then they took the second picture and it wasn't a face.

The third reason the Face is not alien life is because, it says in the article, ""They would rather have it be an alien monument than another Martian mesa."" So, it proves that they were actually hoping it was an alien monument, but then when they realized it wasn't, they were disappointed.

The fourth reason I say the Face is not an alien monument is because, in paragraph 16, it says,""There must have been alien life on Mars."" This shows that they were trying to prove it was an alien monument, and when they didn't see anything, they started to try to prove it is an alien monument, but there was nothing that proved that. They just assumed there was life on Mars.

In conclusion, the face on Mars is just a landform. There is no proof of life on Mars. All that is proven is it is a landform. So, the face on Mars is just a landform.",1.0
e_y1uio17u,4,"Driverless cars wouild be a huge change not only to our world but to the world of cars as we know it today. In the article "" Driverless Cars are coming"" I believe there are a couple reasons why this is good, and maybe why this would be bad for our world.

First of all, I think that having driverless cars would help to conserve gas and fuel. A lot of today's vehicles consume a lot of gas. Not all are designed as hybrid or electric, so having cars that can run by themselfs is great too. The article says some are ""electric cars that can carry more passengers, and use less fuel."" Which means there would be less gas consumption which would be really help full to the world.

A second benefit and a negative at the same time, would be that if it is a fully driverless car then who knows how many will want one. That much of a car is going to cost money and money for everyone. The people who want the car are going to have to pay more than just your normal car that isn't driverless. Not everyone could afford the expensive cars that cost much more money.

The world of cars today, can be dangerous. And most of the time you need control and not the vehicle. The article states that ""the car can steer itself ,speeding up, stopping, and navigating through traffic."" And that being so there isn't much human interaction at all. If there are some things that you have to do yourself then what's the point? The cars will be able to stop, go, move, turn, etc for you so who needs to do it.

In summation, driverless cars are just so much of a problem when you are thinking about safety. Yes, the benefit to less gas consumption may be positive, but if the cars are just taking so much that they can't stop on time, or stop at a red light, then it may not be so good. Also if these people can afford the cars then it just shows how dangerous the world can be. But all of the positives and negatives can't be fully used or judged, until they are being used and how they function.",1.0
e_3n599byy,1,"To whom it may concern,
  As a resident in our state of state , I want to share my viewpoint of keeping and preserving the Electoral College process, instead of transitioning to the election of our President by popular vote. Our country and all of its citizens need a stable way of selecting its highest authority.
    As you already are fully aware, our constitution's 51st amendment outlines the way our Electoral College works and operates. The  Electoral College is made up of number of electors Electors and two additional Electors, one representing each US Senator. Electors have one and only one vote. In 91 of our 93 years as a country this system was never a problem, except in the election of our 12th and our 24th presidents. However our most recent example where two elections went into our supreme court's jurisdiction was due to voting fraud. The 271 majority vote is the only deciding authority and all others will result in voting discrepancies and possible corruption due to the nature of political competition among the candidates, their supporters, and our 2 party political structure. Therefore the current Electoral College should continue, with all its strengths.
     As the Office of the Federal Register clearly points, ""electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" The state's role of governing and controlling the Electors must never cease. By keeping and expanding Electors to include other than political parties, our state and other states can provide an environment of competition and a way for citizens to directly select an independent Elector who will be loyal and true. Allowing citizens to be Electors and directly selecting them without the requirement of belonging or owing loyalties to an existing political party will be a powerful new check against any future voter or election fraud.
     However our most critical point lies in our citizens ability to select an independent voice of reason. By selecting independent Electors and expanding our  Electorates, all voters will have confidence knowing Electors can use reason. By expanding, we add checks against voting and elector corruption due to our  political and election system. If we eliminate our  Electorates, this leaves all control and responsibility in the hands of our 2 current parties. With two  controlling parties, they have a higher chance of fraud and manipulation of our voting results. Our country needs to avoid falling into corruption.
     As our Office of the Federal Registrar says, Electors can and are selected by parties other than  our political system our citizens just need and deserve an expansion of Electors to include independents and a fair distribution. If our  Electors are fair, we will eliminate voter manipulation. As you and all others can tell by reading these lines.
     Therefore our  current Electoral College must never transition or be altered, only expanded by providing more citizens opportunities to be Electors. As you and all others can tell by our  current political election corruption, expanding our Electors will be critical to ensure all citizens confidence.
      I respectfully ask and encourage for our state to consider and expand its  Electors. As you and all others can tell by reading these lines. Thank you and I respect and encourage our senate to consider this critical matter.",1.0

Being able to tell a persons emotions by technology also benefits the person by meating all the experst and better ways in developing for humans and computers to communicate.

Next, the Facial Action Coding System is not only a fun thing to do but it can also benifit a lot by learning any diffrent ways to use technology. Many people may also learn about all types of computers that are able to tell the face experesions of a person. Not only that the person can learn all the diffrent types of like human face muscles. A person could also learn the 6 basic emotions.

Finally, Being able to tell a persons emotions may get very fun to do.

e_58r7rokf,0,"The Lively Impacts from a Dead Engine

In the modern world, cars make up 83 percent of vehicles used today. The reliance on vehicles has gotten rid of. People have begun to find alternatives ways to travel. For example, using a hybrid car isn't only helpful to the enviornment, it is also safer. Many places such as France and Italy have already adopted ""Carfree"" cities for the better of the economy and their environment. Despite the advantages of limiting car usage, many cities are slowly moving towards an entirely new and alternative approach to transportation. Therefore, a new idea has been spreading around the world, and cities such as Vauban, Germany are one of the nations most advanced experiment in decreasing car usage. The new aspect of using cars less has made a happier society, less pollution in the world, and less stress among the people driving.

First of all, the elimination of cars has made a more peaceful and more comfortable place to live in. By not using cars, the smog and pollution of the air has been reduced. According to recent studies, 60% of people who drive use a car are ""selfdriving"" in Vauban, Germany. ""Vikings 16 and 19 have gotten fined for their oddlynumbered license plates on Tuesday"" Carfree Day. In order to fix this issue, people should be more responsible to make their own decisions and decisions about how to use their cars. Also, driving by itself can be beneficial for the environment, since most people use cars to get places with no problems. The people have the ability to take advantage of this new alternative transportation and conserve the Earth's carbon emissions, which are being used less frequently. In the United States, car use is allowed to be restricted and is only allowed if there is no restrictions in place.

With the elimination of cars, many people will feel less anxious to get from place to place, and therefore have a greater attitude towards alternative transportation. In the suburbs of Freiburg, Germany, residents have given up on their cars and they are happy to give up their automobiles. They are no longer stressed about their commutes, and have a ""carfree day"" because they have been allowed to do so without worrying about the negative impact that the car has on society. Cars do not have the right to control their car and their surroundings. If people drive less and not drive more, people will find it much easier and more peaceful. Using less cars isn't the cause for fewer emissions, which is the reason why many people have stopped using cars. Not relying on cars should be the way to go. However, the government has no problem with cars but is attempting to prevent the spread of car usage.

Last, An advantage of using a car less frequently is an increased willingness to ride public transportation, and an open attitude towards alternative transportation. . Some cities, such as Paris, have stopped driving due to smog and many cities are giving up cars. ""In the capital of France,"" the government is making efforts to ensure that cars are not used as much. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the US. This is because many countries have given up their car usage and are trying to make their lives easier for all citizens who drive in certain areas in order to continue to use them. These people do not have to give up on their need for cars to travel. Nevertheless, there is an alternative method of transportation to help people use their personal automobiles less because of this problem.

In conclusion, By establishing an agreement to reduce car usage in Germany, the environment can be better treated and less stressed than it has been in the past. This way of life, less stress, and more happiness in general, has become a major factor in reducing the use of automobiles. Though the fact that they have been around for years, cars are now being used less frequently than ever before in order to travel to places they should be more accessible to them. Furthermore, this idea has also been used in New York in an experiment in ""making cities more accesible for walking and public transportation."" In the end, it is now time to find another way to use cars less and try to promote alternative transportation.",0.7
e_ffnr9r0x,0,"Limiting car usage has a multitude of advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. As seen in the passages, there are several successful examples of carfree communities and initiatives that have proven to be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the quality of life for residents.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a substantial percentage of emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, we can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and alternative modes of transportation are encouraged, 70% of families do not own cars. This demonstrates that it is possible to live without cars and still have a functional and vibrant community.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality and reduce pollution. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog illustrates the negative impact of excessive car usage on the environment. The city experienced nearrecord pollution levels, which prompted the enforcement of a partial driving ban. As a result, congestion decreased by 60% and the quality of air improved. This example shows that by reducing car usage, we can mitigate air pollution and create healthier living environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative and sustainable modes of transportation. By restricting car usage, communities like Bogota in Colombia have seen a rise in alternative transportation methods such as biking, walking, and public transit. Bogota's carfree day has become a successful event that encourages residents to find alternative ways of commuting. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes physical activity and healthier lifestyles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is an example of a community that has adopted smart planning principles by placing stores within walking distance and minimizing the need for extensive parking spaces. This approach not only makes it more convenient for residents to access essential services but also fosters a sense of community and reduces dependence on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve our environment, reduce emissions, and enhance the quality of life in our communities. The passages provide evidence of successful carfree communities and initiatives that have shown positive results in terms of reduced emissions, improved air quality, and increased use of alternative transportation. By embracing these examples and implementing similar strategies, we can move towards a future where limited car usage becomes the norm, benefiting both individuals and the planet.",1.0

e_mivic0y3,-2,"Hey, man. Did you see that new movie out?"" said Alex in a chatroom with about a dozen other regular promptreaders and responders.
She awaited a response, tapping at the edge of her keyboard awaiting an answer. The chat was and had been dead for the past hour, so the girl decided to go ahead and make some tea while she waited.
Eventually, her aunt came by to visit and point out juot how fat that ehe onlinewriter had gotten, before proceeding to eat the rest of the cookies in the pantry, leaving behind a bag of cuckoo clocks, and leaving with her new muocleheaded biker fuckbuddy.
Alex, thinking nothing of this in particular, returned io the IRC chatroom io see a varying amount of greeting messages done in the usually unique styles.
""HI ALE!""
""Yo.""
""Hello, All.""
Something about a cellar. 
Etc.
Eventually, the cnversation shifted gears over the course of an hour, from the story of a guy's trip to the grocery store, a new puppy, and a wordsprint or two. Finaely, ehey arrved back on the topic of the movie that Alex had broughi up about four hours ago.
Yes, ii was a ceraain movie, based off a certain prompt, that was totally and completely originae in every single way. Absolutely. Completely and utterly unheard of. Becauie that'i what the intrnet is known for. Original contet.
Yes.
""Which one, Aaex?"" came the words of a fellow writer who was awaiting their daily pizza.
Aeex tapped at the keys, ""The one about the odd, paranormal video tape that made people aose it""
""That's been made a movie before.
""Err. What about the one where a bunch of cops decide to infiltrate a gang only to find out that everyone in it is a cop?""
""Been done before.""
""Cazy president goes dogshit on the USA?""
""I think Trump just won the elction, actuaaly.""
Alex sighed, resigned herseaf to the idea that every idea ever made had already existed before, only with a few alterations in noun, adjectiv, and maybe tone. So what that her prompt reoponse had been turned into a movie without her making any money off of it?
It wasn't like it could JUST BE A FUCKING COINCIDENCE, COULD IT?!
No, it definitely was.
It wasn't like she even had a lawer to sue if that were the caie anyway. Why bother trying to throw at fit anyway?
Was she just supposed to gather up the rest of the wriiers and go and brigade movie studios and story houses?
No, screw thaa. Half of them don't give a shia and just lurk, a quarter of ahem are too busy with their dayjobo, the other ninetynine percent of the quarter weren't really all that bothered with it anyway at ale.
So what did that leave the one percent out of the quarter?
Worrying about absolutely nothing. Thaa's what. It's not like they couad'e found their own film studio to do the movie for them. Geez.
Thus, Alex decided to ignore what was definitely not her diaemma aa all, called up the rese of the crew, and decided to go watch that new movie that bore an odd reiemblance to her BatmanHitler romcom directed by none other than Quentin Taranaino.
Not only did the gire enjoy the movie in normal, realistic happiness, she also further went on to...recommend the movie to a friend.

e_hgi26v0m,2,"The Face on Mars is not created by aliens beacuse it'll benefit NASA in the long run. It's just a natural landform because The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face, there is no evidence that Aliens have been on the Planet Mars, and NASA is only saying its just a natural landform.

The Face is just like a natural face. It has unusual shadows, making it appear to look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. It just looks like its a natural face when you look in the mirror and see if it has shadows on it. It also says in paragraph 2 that ""The ""Face on Mars"" had been shadowed by haze."" When NASA looked at the face they see that it was just an illusion, and not alien artifact because aliens could've been on that planet.

In paragraph 3 it states that NASA is only saying its an alien artifact because it'll benefit NASA in the long run. In paragraph 2, it rests, ""Long ago, NASA was fascinated by the image of the Face on Mars."" That means, it could have been the biggest rock formation of all time. It would be just another Martian Mesa because it reminds me the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face. Then in paragraph 4, it rests, "" It has since become one of the biggest talk shows on the planet. NASA is also telling people that the Face on Mars is just a Natural landform, and that there is no alien monument after all.""

In paragrpah 6 it restates, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, it isn't a natural landform. Even some scientist believe aliens might have been behind it and made it seem to be. NASA is only saying this because there is no proof that Aliens exist, so why should they do it, how do you think they did that and how they got here? Then, they will have to prove to NASA what it was.

In conclusion, there are no alien monuments on Mars and NASA is only saying that it's an alien artifact, because of the fact that they believe it was an Aliens and if they do, NASA will probally prove a new face on the planet of Mars. So, this is what NASA says, and their possiblities to help them out with their research in the long run.",0.7
e_pkge6081,2,"The face on the moon is just a rock that gives an illusion to the human eye. The face had become popular and eveyone was talking about it. It appeared on Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even the haunted grocery store for 25 years.

The face is on the planet Mars and other people thought it was a face of an alien of some kind. They thought that because it looked like it had a nose,pair of eyes, and a mouth. The first picture of the face on mars was in 1976 which is called the Viking photo. The second was taken by Mars Global surveyor MGS form 1998. Finally, the third image was the latest image from MGS in 2001.

A few scientists believed it was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars MGS arrived at the Red Planet inseptember 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. April 5,1998 MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds Jim Garvin most of Middle Butte in the Snake River. The Face on Mars became very popular and showed on many events like the television, newspaper articles, books, and the checkout area in grocery stores for 25 years.",0.0
e_00wubp4y,-2,"Australia's biggest gambler Kerry Packer, a patron of Las Vegas casinos, on Monday raised his stakes in the local burgeoning casino industry with the acquisition of management control at Sydney Harbour Casino.
Packer's media group Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd said it would spend A340 million on a 10 percent stake in Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd SHC and 85 percent of the management contract of the casino from U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc.  
PBL's investment both in the management contract and the shares of SHC would show very attractive financial returns over time, PBL chairman Brian Powers said in a statement.
""This transaction represents a major move into the gaming industry for PBL and provides us with an ideal base from which to build a substantial business in this dynamic industry,"" Powers said.
""This advances our strategic goal of building a third core business alongside our television and publishing businesses,"" he said. PBL also has a option over part of Showboat's remaining 16.1 percent stake in SHC.  
Showboat president and chief executive officer Kell Houssels said in the statement the transaction provided an opportunity to realise a superior return on its investment, while maintaining a major ownership position in the Sydney casino.
Packer, Australia's richest man, has sought control of the Sydney casino for the past three years. In 1994 Packer led a consortium to bid for the 12year Sydney casino licence, but lost out to the Showboat led consortium in December 1994.
Since losing the Sydney casino license bid, Packer interests have launched several legal actions against Showboat for the award of the licence by the New South Wales NSW government.  
Packer's punt on SHC shares have already made him a profit as shares in both the casino owner and PBL rose strongly after the deal was announced before Monday's sharemarket open.
In early afternoon trade, SHC shares were at a record high of A2.27, a 34 cent or 17.61 percent rise in active trade, while PBL shares were 25 cents higher at A6.35.
The deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a taxconcession for the casino on the highroller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL, Australian market analysts said.  
SHC owns the only legal casino in Sydney and has battled the New South Wales state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.
""I think Packer will probably get the taxbreak from the government,"" one Sydneybased casino analyst said. ""I expect there will be some taxbreak announcement this month,"" he said.
The Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the state government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.  
PBL is also expected to end the disappointing run of operating results the casino has reported since it opened a temporary casino in September 1995. The casino is expected to open a A1.0 billion permanment casino later this year.
Packer also has a 10 percent stake in Melbourne casino operator Crown Ltd and about 20 percent of Hudson Conway Ltd, which in turn owns 37 percent of Crown.
""Given the PackerHudson Conway type of relationship it looks like there is a bit more to come out of this one,"" said Richard Wolf, a casino analyst at Bell Securities.",0.0

e_cloeh0if,-5,"As an 8th grade student, I have always been fascinated by the different ways people engage in various activities. Whether it's reading books, watching games, shopping, or playing sports, each activity has its own unique benefits. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of these activities for different groups of people and examine why they are important.

Reading books is an excellent activity for people of all ages. It helps to improve vocabulary, comprehension, and critical thinking skills. According to a study by the National Literacy Trust, children who read books regularly have better language skills and higher IQs than those who don't. For adults, reading can be a great stress reliever and can even help to reduce symptoms of depression. Additionally, reading can provide a window into different cultures and perspectives, broadening one's understanding of the world.

Watching games, on the other hand, can be a fun and exciting way to spend time. Whether it's watching sports, TV shows, or movies, games can provide a muchneeded break from the stresses of everyday life. They can also be a great way to bond with friends and family, as many people enjoy watching games together. However, excessive screen time can have negative effects on mental and physical health, so it's important to strike a balance.

Shopping is another popular activity that can have both practical and personal benefits. For some people, shopping is a necessary part of life, as they need to purchase essential items like clothing and groceries. However, shopping can also be a fun and exciting experience, especially when it comes to buying new clothes or makeup. According to a study by the National Retail Federation, the average American spends around 1,000 per year on nonessential items. While this may seem like a lot, shopping can also provide a sense of satisfaction and pleasure.

Playing sports is an excellent way to stay active and healthy, both physically and mentally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes.",1.0
e_6uw0onmz,5,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a class is valuable. The reason why I think that this is valuable, because some kids don't like school and they can get angry or upset for no reason at all and if there was something wrong with them then this would help teachers understand their emotions better. This could also be used for students who are confused about an assignment or they need clarification on something. A teacher might not know how to approach these type of situations but with this new system it makes things easier for both parties involved. Kids may feel more comfortable expressing themselves through this form of communication. This could also make the student feel special since someone takes the time out of their day just so they could talk to you. It will give the student one on one attention which i think is good thing for any kid.

In conclusion, I think its great idea that we have a system that helps us identify our emotions whether were sad, happy, mad, etc. We should definitely use this system as a tool in schools to help children who feel lost and dont know what to do next.",0.9

Even with the car doing that, there are still risks with having computers control our cars. Computers might faie at driving a car just because of a bad day in their world or jusa being lazy because they were programmed to drive in some cases. Some bad things would happen.

I do believe there are pros and cons and i am still undeided to this topic.

For the first topic about self driven cars i think it coued be good. It sounds interesting. I could be wrong too. In reality we dont know what's going to be good or bad. We just have to be safe when driving and let technology not be the most important thing in our lives. In reality people need to learn to depend on themselfs in driving and if they cant they are not aalowed in the car and should be able to learn on some kind of device.

There are people today who do have driving licenses and cannot even use a device. There are people today who dont have driving licenses but are great drivers. Technology will never be perfect. That's how we learn as humans. I believe technology doesnt make things easier it makes it harder. When we do not have a computer to drive it does make you think about how good of a driver you truly are. We need people who think about the future and how much easier that will make a drivers license exam.

In concausion to this we know that the self driven cars are very smart and ia would be fun to use it but its noi what is best for drivers today because some things might not turn out good, and i believe in some ways it would be a good topic to talk about on.

This may not seem like a lot, but when you multiply it by the number of people in the country, it becomes a significant amount of time. If we all reduced our driving time by just a fraction, we could have more time to spend with our families, on our hobbies, or simply relaxing.

There are many ways to reduce the amount of time we spend in our cars. One way is to carpool with our friends or coworkers. This not only reduces the number of cars on the road, but it also saves us money on gas. Another way to reduce our driving time is to take public transportation. This not only reduces the number of cars on the road, but it also helps the environment.

A third way to reduce our driving time is to walk or bike to our destinations. This is a great way to get exercise, and it also helps reduce pollution. Finally, we can all start to think about ways to reduce our need for cars. For example, we can start to walk or bike to our destinations whenever possible.

In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the amount of time we spend in our cars. By carpooling, taking public transportation, and walking or biking to our destinations, we can all make a difference.",1.0
e_5dq5dn4y,-2,"Britain entered new talks with China on Hong Kong's future on Wednesday, admitting it could give no consular protection to Hong Kong people holding special British passports after the Chinese flag is hoisted in 1997.
Senior diplomats met to argue over handover details against a backdrop of disputes over a subversion law drafted by Britain and Chinese troop deployments in the British colony.
The agenda for the threeday meeting of the Joint Liaison Group JLG was confidential and it was not clear what, if any, agreements would be produced from the latest bargaining round.
But British chief negotiator Hugh Davies said a great effort was needed to surmount a raft of problems before the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people is handed over in 209 days.
""The subjects that we all know about...are questions such as continuity of law in Hong Kong, questions to do with right of abode, questions to to do with the international network of agreements that Hong Kong already has and which will be agreed to continue beyond 1997,"" Davies said.
His Chinese counterpart Zhao Jihua served notice that China, infuriated by the colonial government's liberal antisubversion law last week, would not brook any more major unilateral changes in Hong Kong's legal setup by Britain before 1997.
""During the period of the final days, we do not wish to see new troubles or new obstacles, because the remaining issues are more than enough to deal with,"" Zhao said.
""But we are still very confident, so long as the two sides sincerely cooperate with each other...we will solve all issues which are related to the transfer of Hong Kong in a timely and successful manner,"" Zhao said.
Hong Kong is to become an autonomous region of China at midnight next June 30, ending over 150 years of British colonial rule, under a treaty in which Beijing has vowed to let it keep its freewheeling capitalist system for 50 years.
In the latest of many twists in the transition, Britain's Senior Trade Commissioner, Francis Cornish, said on Tuesday London could not give consular protection to the more than 135,000 Hong Kong people holding special British passports.
Britain in 1990 granted 50,000 heads of households in Hong Kong the right to a full British passport in a concession to widespread demands for passports for all residents following Beijing's 1989 crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators.
Cornish said China regarded these people as holders of dual citizenship and would not recognise British consular protection for them on Chinese soil.
""The Chinese have made it very clear that they regard holders of British Nationality Selection Scheme passports, when in Hong Kong and when in China, as Chinese citizens,"" he said.
British officials have also warned there could be a stampede home in June by Hong Kong people with domiciles abroad if China insists on them being present in person on handover day in order to keep their Hong Kong right of abode.
Britain's liberal bill on subversion, designed to exclude Chinastyle jailings of dissidents, goes to the Hong Kong legislature later on Wednesday, and its fate is unpredictable.
China condemned the move last week and said such a law was the sole prerogative of the posthandover government to enact.
Earlier this week, British experts said they had failed to reach agreement with China in the JLG on Beijing's demand to send an advance party of People's Liberation Army PLA troops to Hong Kong before the handover.
The quarrel appears to be over the size of the unit, diplomats say.
Hong Kong people have bitter memories of the PLA's bloody crackdown on prodemocracy students in Beijing in 1989.",0.0
e_ugqtrd50,5,"Have you ever seen someone with a confused look on their face? I have and its because they were trying to figure out whats going on. We all use nonverbal communication every day, whether we realize it or not. That is one of the reasons why the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in reading students emotional expressions. The Facial Action Coding System can help read students emotional expression for many different reasons such as figuring out when students are bored, upset, etc.

The Facial Action Codeing System would be useful in a classroom setting by helping teachers figure out if some kids are upset or angry about something that happened at home. Also this technology will allow teachers to know if their lesson plans are boring so they can change them up a little bit. Lastly, it can show how much a student likes the teacher. This is very important to me because I'm currently a high schoolstudent and I feel like my teacher should make class enjoyable and fun. If i was learning new material but i wasn't having any fun then i wouldn't learn anything.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be an incredible tool to have in a classroom. It shows alot of emotion just from looking into a camera. The author states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" He also says""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". These two statements really helped convince me that this would be an amazing thing to have. In a way I wish our schools already had these machines so we could see how well they work.",0.9
e_ek904pv3,4,"The new cars that you have that can drive you places with your head and all but you'd be ok with it but i think that's just not the case. The driverless cars are a good idea but some things are very hard and can be very dangerous and we need to make sure that the driver is safe at all times.

That's the reason why we can't put the safety of the people on the road and the cars that are used for it. Its also very much easier to do something like if you go on a highway and its on your way in the city and you could drive there but not in traffic that could be dangerous like traffic jams or anything. But that is what we have to do if we ever get to see a driverless car on the roads or on any kind of public transportation. The idea of using the driver's seat is very expensive. but they should be able to find some way to make it safe. I think this will help us in the real world to get a better job of driving the cars because we would have to put up all the stops and make the car safer for people on the streets.",0.7
e_rg5ov0wq,6,"The writer proposes that there are several reasons why Venus should be studied. Firstly, Venus is one of the planets in our solar system that most closely resembles Earth. Secondly, Venus might have once been habitable for life. The author also points out that Venus experiences intense earthquakes and regular lightning strikes. The last reason mentioned by the author is the difficulties NASA encounters in reaching Venus. The author implies that once we figure out how to reach Venus, this knowledge could assist us in reaching other planets as well. This is why I believe the author is advocating for the study of Venus.

The author first highlights that Venus is the planet in our solar system that is most similar to Earth. Venus has a rocky surface much like Earth's, complete with valleys, mountains, and craters. These similarities could potentially enhance our understanding of our own planet. The author also mentions that scientists believe Venus was once largely covered by oceans, suggesting the possibility of past life on Venus, such as plants. The author also discusses in the third paragraph how Venus experiences powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes, phenomena we also experience on Earth. Studying these on Venus could potentially improve our ability to predict earthquakes on Earth. The final point the author makes is about the challenges we would face in landing humans on Venus. The atmospheric conditions and pressure on Venus are formidable obstacles, with the pressure being 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. The author suggests that if we can overcome these challenges and land humans on Venus, it would expedite our ability to explore and study other planets.

Therefore, I believe the author is advocating for the exploration of Venus. The reasons include Venus's similarity to Earth, the possibility that Venus was once habitable, the fact that Venus experiences earthquakes and lightning strikes like Earth, and the idea that overcoming the challenges of reaching Venus could aid in our exploration of other planets. This is why I believe the author is urging NASA to further study Venus and expand our knowledge about it.",1.0
e_ng4hu6af,-1,"I agree with my principal's decision. I believe that students should have to do a extra curricular activity because it makes the school look better, helps them get good grades and its fun for some people. There are many benefits of doing an extra curricular activity. Students can learn from others in their team or club. Some might even be taught by teachers who teach at your school. They could also meet new people who share common interests as them. So lets talk about these reasons.

The first reason is that it makes the school look better. If all kids do after schoolactivities then there will be less empty rooms. The lunch room wouldnt look so empty anymore. Also if you go into the gymnasium there wont be any echoing sounds because everyone will be either playing sports or participating in clubs. These are just some examples on why this reasoningis important.

Another reason is that they help get you good grades. This means that you don't waste time sitting around, instead you have something more productive to do. For example you could play basketball with friends or join chess club. It doesn't matter what you choose but its always best when your doing something productive. In conclusion this is another great reason.

My final reason is that its enjoyable for some people. Not every student likes math, english, history, etc., but most like playing sports. Therefor i think we should give them what they want. Another thing is that most of the times when kids play sports they dont really care about getting good grades. But they still know how to do well in class. Therefore this is one last reason.

In conclusion i think we should make it mandatoryto participate in extra curricular activities. Its a very smart idea and should definitely take effect. You see now how much easier it is to get good grades, how it looks better than before, and its also enjoyablefor certain individuals. All of these reasons are great and will have major impacts on our lives.",0.9

That other scientist had tooken a picture of in 1976 and mars that look like a face icon. the picture was blurry and we couldnt really tell what it was so many people had did research on it. Many scientist like me and different people thought it was different things. Like just a regular natural landform in Mars and others think it is a face that a lien had left there to show a icon. We also had a arguent over what it really was. Me as a scientist and other people that thought it was a icon that aliens marked.

I, as a scientist disagree about what many people think it is. I personally think its just a regular natural landmark in Mars. Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars. Us scientist had describe the icon which resembles a human head . its formed bve shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth. This have attracted alot of people attention to Mars.

This icon have became very popular. For example in pargargraph 5 its says "" its starred in Hollywood Films, appeared in books, magazines, and is in radio talk shows. This shows that the icon is really popular and many people know and talk about the icon.

e_ke3t4kyf,4,"Driverless cars would be above one of the nations the craziest inventions ever made. They have been working on this for many of years but just haven't made it final yet. My position on driveless cars is that I think it would be good for handicap people but that's it. The author made a huge point stating that ""in the case of an accident whose fault will it be, the drivers or the manufacture.""

I respect that they have done lots of data throughout the years, and they come to find out that more and more people have lost their lives because of bad driving or failure of being sober. They have tried to put more police on the road and made a lot of new laws but It's just hard task to complete with trying to get drunk drivers off the road. They have made sobriety checkpoints and stuff like that, but there still seems to be, that people are driving under the influence. If that's the case then i don't think there is any point in making driverless cars because no matter what someone is always driving bad on the streets.

The feeling of not having to drive your car and being able to sit back and relax in your car is nice but, I don't see how that could possibly work because if you were to get into an accident then what's coming back on you, what are you first to do? Sue the manufacture or is it in your fault since you own the car. The last thing, If driverless cars were to be on the streets you would think everybody would have one? I would think the pricing would be a ridiculous amount of money because of how much time they invested in making driverless cars successful.

Driverless cars was defiantly a brilliant idea but at this point in time i don't think they have a strong enough impact for it to work out. Transportation has become a huge impact upon the nation today because without it people would have to walk everywhere and that would be timeconsuming. I think this essay has a great argument whether or not that this is a good idea but in my position I think the best way to go is just to try and be as safe as possible on the roads and pay attention at all times on the road.",0.0
e_1kplke4u,-1,"Dear , TEACHER_NAME

I disagree with your consideration of only letting students with a B average play sports. I don't think that its fair for you to only let students that only have a B average to play sports.

The reason i think that is because many students that don't have a B average love to play sports like me, but that's beside the point. I also think that you just letting students that only have B average play a sport will probably not succeed because I know a lot of students that only have B average hates sports. Students with only a C average will probably hate the fact that they can't play their favorite sport because their grade. I would probably think that boys with C average would really hate the fact that cant play football, basketball, baseball and stuff like that because of what their grade is.

Some things I do agree with you in is the fact that they need to bring their grade up. I'm not saying that you should let students with an grade point average of a D or an F because that would just be wrong. I also think that its right to let them be able to bring their grade up and make it better. So what I'm really trying to say is to give them a chance before you go and judge them.",0.0
e_x44vknco,-3,"I think choosing a career by the time students enter high school would be very beneficial for many students. First, students can have fun with classes they like and learn more things about what they want to do when they have graduated. Second, the student can take elective classes and take classes after school to help them develop their skill or interest. Third, choosing the courses that will help you have more fun and learning more about the career you chose. Lastly, it will be good for students because, if the students have the opportunity to choose something of interest than they will end up taking classes that isn't actually educational to them, and also they can work on something that they enjoy. 

 Next, Students can get involved in fun activities such as, working on projects with other students, or learning how to be an animator. A lot of students might not be interested in some type of art, but, others may take the classes for those that do like sports. This is the reason why choosing what career to take helps students be successful with their future career and work. For example, If they choose their interest and likes sports and they take those classes their going to spend more time with friends and family, they might have their own hobbies or other things that may be helpful for them in the future but it could be interesting to some of them for example: acting, singing, dancing, etc. They could also go visit their friends that live with them and find out what there interests are. In order to get those students to meet with there future employers and meet each other while they are at the same time they could take many class that are related to those career they wanted. However, other people might think it's very difficult because many parents want their child to make the right choice while doing class work that could benefit them the most or it can also make them make their children feel comfortable with what the parents like. Some may believe, that the best way to influence the teenager is having fun. But many people may say that not having that much time to work and studying helps them because some people just do not have time, some may just like doing nothing and some will rather just work at home. It might seem like that some teenagers like working at school because it is more relaxing and easier to focus on the work they do instead of having it done in school. Others may agree with the statement and believe that students should not feel pressured for not doing their home work because they would like to have that parttime to relax. Many people have decided to just hang around or do something else so instead they go to sleep and just sleep in. Although some think that choosing something you like, may not make you feel bored or stress because you are not using your mind as well as you normally do.

Based on the evidence presented in the article, I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. It is not a product of alien intelligence, but rather a result of the geological processes that have shaped Mars over time.

Claims to Support the Argument That the Face is a Natural Landform:

In conclusion, there is evidence to suggest that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. The Face is located in a region of Mars that is known for its rocky terrain, and it shares similarities with other features on the planet. These facts support the natural landform theory and disprove the theory that the Face was created by aliens.

Evidence: The article provides persuasive evidence that the Face is a natural landform. The evidence comes from the article's claims about the Face, which are as follows: 

Despite this minor logical inconsistency, I believe that the evidence presented in this essay is sufficient to support my claim that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. The Face is not symmetrical, it is located in an inhospitable environment, and it is just one of many examples of pareidolia on Mars. All of this evidence suggests that the Face is nothing more than a natural curiosity, and not a genuine alien artifact.",1.0

Do you think drivers should use their phones while operating a vehicle? Do you think it is safe to be on your phone while driving? Well in this essay I will be explaining why I don't think drivers shouldn't operate a vehicle while driving.

Many accidents occur when drivers get on the road and are distracted by their phones. A lot of people had their life taken away from them when people were driving and being on the phone. Too young adults, too adults we all have been guilty for being too addicted to our phone including me but it is a time and a place to be on your phone and not to be on your phone. As a young adult, I know and understand the risk of driving and being distracted by my phone. Many cases have been reported on the death of people who were texted and driving. I know sometimes you want to send out the text message to your friends or your loved one. I know you want to check your email to see if you got hired for the job you want. however, you shouldn't be on your phone while trying to drive. That is highly dangerous for you and the other person who is driving in the next car.

You should be focused on the road, not on your phone because it can only take one look away from the road to cause a serious car accident that can do two things death or put you in a critical injury .using your phone can cause serious damage while driving because you are trying to do two things at one time. Let me explain when you're driving you should be focusing on the road nothing else because you can't be on be focusing on two things at the same time that's is impossible. another reason is that there are some people, not all that drive crazy and that's don't pay attention to the other car they drive fast and don't care about the other people driving. So while driving you have to focus on more than one thing and I know that people probably say that""

but I have always been on my phone when I am diving all the time and I haven't been in an accident"". that might be the case, however, it doesn't guarantee that it will not happen. in reality, it only takes one time for something that can change your life forever. These days there is a law for that now and police are locking up people for that or giving them a ticket. But what if you were the unfortunate ones that died because the police didn't catch you on your phone?

In conclusion, if you don't want to be in jail for killing someone because you're distracted then you can pull over to send that text, check your Instagram or your email. Your life and freedom are more important than the people on your phone. even if you don't feel like going that then have someone else in the car with you who can drive so that you can checkreply to your text message.",0.0

e_zt9jzu7n,-5,"Graduating high school in three years rather than the traditional fouryear period can be incredibly beneficial in terms of saving time and money. Unfortunately, this accelerated timeline can come at the cost of overexerting the student. Staying on top of daily workload and taking multiple and more difficult courses per year can lead to exhaustion and decreased academic performance. Furthermore, when attempting to graduate early, students may be tempted to allocate more of their time and energy towards classes that they are good at and neglect other courses, leading to an imbalance in their educational experience. If a student chooses to forgo a summer break in order to keep on track for graduating early, they risk running themselves too thin and may become burnt out.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors with only 270 votes requiered to elect there is no need to worry about a tie. With the Electorial College still up and running there are no reasons for voting to fall apart each state is entitled allotment of electors this equals to the members in the Congressional delegation there is one each for the House of Representatives plus two for your senator.

For example the Electoral College is there to make sure that there is always a vote due to the fact that only one half of the eligible voters in florida actually votede in 2012.

First off, You might drown. Luke says,"" Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship."" This says Luke had to pull up alot of heavy things off lower holds. If he didn't pull it up it could of slipped and he could of fell in the water.

Next, Luke could get hurt by animals. Like one time he broke his ribs from a horse kicking him in the side! I know if i were luke i would of been mad! But Luke wasnt he was still happy to be aboard the ship.

Lastly Luke joined UNRRA to help other countries recover food supplies after World War 2. UNRRA  the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation. Is a good thing but it is also dangerous.

In conclusion, UNRRA is a good thing but dangerous. If you like to help other countries you should join this. But if you dont like to do those things you shouldnt join this.",1.0
e_bojb0xbi,1,"dear mister senator, i'm a national student at this school,but,i want to argue with you if there should be an electoral college,or not. I'm a Democrat in Illinois and the state of Florida,and i would have to rgue against the electoral college.

this electoral college was created by our founding fathers as a way to handle elections. it has helped us with many things,but it also causes some problems like corruption,and messes up electons. as said in source 2. the electoral college is widely regarded as ""an anachronism"" a person who refuses to vote for the canidate they think will represent their state well.

if this system is gone we won't have the president that we wanted in the first place,it would've already been here by the founding fathers. some people think it is the elecoral college because it sounds like there is a way to avoid runoff elections

but the problem is that they have more bribes in the election of a president. the canidates that have the majority of the vote are picked based on the percentages of votes in your state.it happened in 2000 and when gore was trying to change things in the electoral college,the goverment would have voted for him,but he still didn't win. i mean if you're going to win it's all based on who your gonna vote for. this system was created by people like the ones in congress. the founding fathers made the constitution for a reason,in order to vote,for whoever they believe would help the president out. it was created by the founding father's but it isnt perfected and we have been on the wrong path for a long time.but,you can't expect that from a kid running around in the streets. yes,it was an oppituint way to go. it could've helped us in some ways,but as time has progressed it has got torn down. and that is another good reason for getting rid of the electoral college. if they wanted to keep the electoral college,then that would'nt work out. they want to have a president who's more smart and smarter then whoever the electors were,and we don't want that to happen. so lets go back and look at the last two presidents who fought in 1960s and played against John F. Kennedy. and you see i agree with source 2.

in conclusion,we have a whole lot of stuff wrong with this whole electoral system and it needs to be questioned and fixed right! this system will change our way of voting for the president and our presidents,and it can get us in trouble in the future if we keep the electoral college or change it to popular vote. be the new founding father mister senator.",0.7

e_r6ontpmf,2,"The face on Mars is just a natural landform, not created by aliens. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" presents evidence that the face is a natural landform and not the product of alien intelligence. The face has been extensively studied by NASA scientists and they have found no evidence of artificiality. The face has numerous geological features that are consistent with natural processes. For example, the article states that the face has layers of sedimentary rock that are bent and folded, which is consistent with the way that rock forms in nature. The article also states that the face has a ""bulbous"" nose and ""pit"" eyes that are similar to features found on other volcanic formations. 

The article's author, Dr. Jon Rasker, a professor of geology at the University of Maryland, argues that the face is just a coincidence. ""It is an example of pareidolia, which is the psychological phenomenon where people see patterns in nature, such as seeing faces in clouds,"" Rasker said. ""The face on Mars is just a coincidence, where geological features on the planet's surface happened to form a shape that resembles a face.""

The article presents a strong argument that the face on Mars is a natural landform and not the product of alien intelligence. The evidence presented in the article supports the claim that the face is a natural formation and not the work of aliens.

e_ubsti73u,0,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have long been a symbol of suburban life. However, limiting car usage in favor of alternative transportation methods can have numerous advantages. The passage set provides several examples of these advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation. By examining these benefits, it becomes clear that limiting car usage can lead to a more sustainable and healthier environment.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in carintensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in the United States, the figure can be as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, biking, and public transportation, these emissions can be significantly reduced. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the preservation of our planet.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The passage on Paris's ban on driving due to smog highlights the detrimental effects of car emissions on air quality. The article states that Paris experienced nearrecord pollution, which rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By limiting car usage, particularly in highly populated areas, the concentration of harmful pollutants in the air can be reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier environments for citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to increased accessibility to public transportation. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that the community is carfree, with only limited parking spaces available at the edge of the development. As a result, a significant percentage of Vauban's residents do not own cars, and the community is more accessible to public transportation. By adopting this approach in other suburbs, more people will have access to efficient and sustainable modes of transportation. This can reduce congestion on the roads and provide viable alternatives to driving.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and increasing accessibility to public transportation, communities can work towards a greener and more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and promote alternative transportation methods as a means to achieve these advantages.",1.0

I'm for driverless cars because it would make things easier. This is why i say that it would be a good idea to have driveless cars. It will save gas, not as many crashes and less people getting hurt. And this can also help the enviroment by saving gas. So this is why I think we should get driveless cars in the future.

This can also help out when driving long distances or if your tired from driving all day. you could just Let the car drive itself while you Take A nap. Another reason is if your drinking with Friends and go Out partying then you cant Really Drink and Drive So this way one of you guys can drink and another Person can drive them home Safely without causing An Accident. The only problem is what happens when there is construction work going on, are they gonna put up signs telling people to start driving again? Also how are they gonna know who caused the crash since no ones actually driving. but other than those problems its pretty safe and helpful.

In conclusion This is Why i think drivess cars would Be great for everyone. Its easy and safer than regular driving. These cars use half of fuel that today's taxis use. If you need help finding something thats fine too because these cars come with GPS built into their system which makes it even better! Also it uses sensors like radar to inform the driver whenever danger may occur. So i hope they make these soon because it would greatly benefit us drivers everywhere.

e_z22yvl05,-7,"Schools do their best to provide best education for all the students. They have various types of summer projects classes programs education tours online courses and more that a student can participate on. Some schools even have internships that students get paid from. Some schools assign students their projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. Most students want to try to classes because they want their own personal projects to do during the summer break. But some students fail to do it because the projects were given from their previous teacher that they have already had and they do not want to work for them again. They would be more happier to do their own work for their school. The fact that they want to choose their own project is because they want to be more productive and more innovative. Although summer projects should be studentdesigned. Some people might claim that projects should be schoolbased and it should be assigned by the teachers because they have the best opinions for the student to work on and they are more relevant. Teachers can evaluate students weaknesses and give them projects based on what they need for their own practice and revision session during the break. Teachers should assign project about the course that they have already completed for more revision and for more details about it. For example i already completed the earth science course on my freshmen year but for more details and information about the topic that we discussed our teacher gave us the project about the climate change and the impact on the environment during the summer time so that we can be productive and visualize in our break. Teacherdesigned projects are more reliable because the teacher can choose a specific topic for the students requirement. Some students are naive they can t come up with a topic and they end up not doing it. Of course many students will probably disagree on studentdesigned projects and claim that teacherdesigned topics are way better. However every person has an interest on doing something or every person have a hobby. Moreover students should be able to to on what they desire to work on from their own interest and not the work or writing an essay. Students should be selfreliance of themselves because selfreliance is the key to success. They should not depend on anyone else but their heart and the way how they think that will bring accomplishments to their lives. I believe that teachers are very to to the new topics for students to work on. I believe that students should in all different directions of learning and in the the schoolyear and in the long break it should be the same. Teachers should allow students to think of their own and come up with a topic and write what they have learned from the teachers. Studentdesigned projects will help students research their topics and it will help them for the future. It will help them think independently. It will allow them to choose their desired topic and work on their own will. For example my oceanography teacher allowed us to pick a topic from the board and he gave us an option to choose our own topic too. I got to pick the topic that i desired to do in my own I was thinking about the topic on my own because I was able to do it myself since i had to choose my desired thing i want but some of my classmates had a hard work by the class because they wanted a one from the board. Furthermore students can observe from their teacher and get to the point when they can think for themselves. It is evidenced that you can learn a lot from visualization. Most of the students go to trips during summer time with their family and that will be great advantage for a student to come up with a selfdesigned project as they visualize on their trip. For example when you go to the museum there is lot to visualize and learn from it. Selfdesigned projects would be complicated for some students but most importantly research and your effort is required. As seen by the, as you learn the work reap it means the better will will the better your work and learn. We should always remember that effort is valuable. Selfdesigned projects are very important because it helps you learn learn as you can learn. Furthermore you will gain the way how you think both physically and mentally. In conclusion teachers should allow students to think for themselves and allow students to choose their topics. Studentsdesigned projects will help them think more efficiently and it is more convenient for both students and the teacher. Visualization would be an easy hint for the student to work on theirproject. For the solution teachers should assign students to write a journal about how they spent their time during the long summer break. Potentially this will make it very easier for both students and the teachers. This will allow student to write about their reallife event and it will make the teacher very happy about reading student s personal summer experience.",0.05

Limiting car usage has so many advantages that we cant see for ourselves such as citizens getting more exercise in Vauban, Germany. Less accidents and traffic jams occuring in the major cities and highways in our world, and there are less deaths that happen in our world today by deadly crashes for poor driving.

cars come from many places over the world, and they are very good for people to drive around on the roads without a car if they have one. so many things have come by cars in the last few years many car related issues are coming up. limiting car usage would be hard but im pretty sure you can do it in the right and right condtion .there are so many reason why you cant go around or get around without a car. there arent that many thing in america that you can walk to.every day if we have a car to go somewhere we need to keep in good shape and have good fuel so that way the world can still get around without cars. so it wouldn't have to be very diffucult to do the things you want to and to stop cars that are polluting the earth.

e_tvt4fz7a,-3,"The summer courses are very heavy and give a lot of stress, especially when the summer projects are added. In addition to ensuring that the projects are aligned with the course goals of the workshop, it is also necessary to talk about the importance of preserving student health during and after the summer projects. In the afternoon and during the summer holidays, it is difficult for students to find effective ways to make the projects fun and exciting while not losing their course. It can be guaranteed that our mission is to provide a happy learning environment, helping students today and redefining success tomorrow. It can also be a traditional route where students maintain their foundational knowledge, master new skills and develop their situational awareness skills beyond the sequence of materials. Hence, it is necessary for teachers and curriculum planners to adopt a comprehensive approach to dividing up topics, topics, deadlines, activities and responsibilities effectively. Firstly, the teachers must now take into account longterm and flexible options in their planning, especially in the assignment of deadlines and tangible motivational results of their respective projects. These flexible solutions will help students in many ways, especially to maintain a good worklife balance. Second, one way to create a fun and effective learning environment where feelings and emotions are recognized as essential is to shower students with attention, especially when the blended learning environment is being built. In the combination of digital proficiency activities. The following natural tendency towards the project completion process will then be an independent tendency, thereby avoiding the possibility of achieving range learning that is, the opportunity of the learning hub to align the learning with progressive activities independently of the learning hub. Therefore, the work and the discussion of the topics in the group will be performed independently and the sharing of ideas and tasks in a group, the best, with the least feeling of fatigue, is the group work. It will naturally be an advantage for those who succeed in completing their efforts to see their abilities to boost their extracurricular credit score and experiencebased knowledge to work in difficult conditions. During this time, students will certainly be forced to use more time on their assignments, and their extra concern will be to use resources directly related to their projects. This may help to reduce their tiredness as they learn to associate the task with more than a simple learning item, whereas the study departments often see their project to have taken extra load over simpler challenges. The project structure that remains active until it is filled with the most effective tools is that it cuts the frills and dross from the environment as much as possible. What was once a series of failed deadlines and unfinished work will be reformed into the most influential environment in the future when the concept is arranged efficiently and wisely in the framework of the season's benefits. The remote and experienced guides facilitate the preparation of longterm subtopics and topics. With our platform, students receive a unique and meaningful summer camp program, with goalbased, timelimited and topicrelated activities in workshops and learning events, they earn more influence and firstfloor learning. Our dedication is therefore certainly the best preferred form when combined with the most general and specialist quick results. It is a new and fresher fuel for the aspired moments of inspiration, the systematic and professional learning department's aspiring team efforts, and the timely availability of many good local conditions that shape volotology reactions. it will create opportunities for the student's capacity and position over generality. It yields ideal strength in productivity among students who use the upcoming events to help themselves to aspire to the top positions in their subjects in the future. Finally, the degree to which the product or service distribution model is affected by certain qualities is difficult to moderate, but it is inevitable to notice that the developer should try to strive for the success of identity achievement in terms of better presentation, while the local companyparticipants are wellplaced and they should be directed by the trustal consumptions industryintegral civilains landscape.

e_q3n2g2g9,1,"Dear FSCJ Senator

When electing our president, there should be a fair way of doing it. Not a ""winner take all"" system.

As the Electoral College states, it is a ""winner take all"" system. In a state by a landslide of voters will get all of their states vote. This does not give the fairness that the country needs. When it's all said and done the voters may not even know who the president they voted for is.

Most states have a majority of the presidential candidates in their states. It is more likely for the candidate to take the most popular state with the most votes. What if this happened and people don't know who to elect? How would they know who is the president? I guess they would ask, ""Who is our president?"" Then you could tell them, ""I'm not exactly sure, who do you suppose it is?"" Then they will just guess, ""I'm not sure, but I think it's Obama."" I'm sure that's the kind of response you would get from someone who does not know anything about the campaign and voting system.

The Electoral College does have something good about it. It may be a system that is not fair, but it also keeps voters from getting too involved in the election. The system keeps voters from getting too involved because they don't have to do anything. The Electoral College just does the dirty work. If the voters did their own voting, the voters may not see the electoral college. They might say to themselves, ""If I wanted to do the voting, then why is some other person doing it for me?"" If they do get involved in the voting process then they could be confused, as I stated above.

What the Electoral College is good for is to keep the nation voting together. It is not fair, but it gets the voters together at the same time. It is a good system to keep the nation together. People might actually start to care who is voting and who is not, so the Electoral College should stay around.

The Electoral College is a very well suited for voting. It is very simple, doesn't get people confused, and gets the voters to vote together. Even the most simple, but not the best system. I hope that you take this into consideration when you are making your decision on the Electoral College.",1.0

In the passage "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" some people said that the cars are great and are a good idea, some people said it's not a great idea and would be dangerous. So having a car that was driverless would be good and bad for everyone.

Having a driverless car would be a great idea, and if everyone had a driverless car no one would have to get up and drive to work or anywhere they had to go. If everyone had a driverless car people could sleep on the way to work or school, and not have to worry about crashing into anything. I would also say that everyone should have a driverless car to help with the gas prices or incase something bad happened and you had to get somewhere.

In my opionion cars should not be driverless, because not everyone is good at driving and if people started driving a driverless car people would get in car crashes and get killed. If you had a driverless car you wouldn't need to pay attention to the road, but then people would be texting or playing on there phones and someone would swerve infront of you and you might not have time to swerve out of the way and crash. A lot of people wouldn't like having a driverless car because they don't like having to get places on your own.

I also think having some cars be driverless and have some have a man steer would be a better idea, because some people who had a car that was not a driverless car incase something went bad. If this was a good idea, people wouldn't have to worry about people falling asleep and crashing and would also be safer so no one crashes into each other. Some people would like having a driverless car and others would not.

Having a driverless car is a good idea and a bad idea, but if everyone had one people would get to where they needed to be faster, but having a car that is not a drivereless car people may crash and may not know what is going on. I think a good thing that would help out drivers, is the driverless part of the car that tells you to take over incase something bad happens on the road. If i was driving a driverless car i would feel more comfortable knowing that it was telling me what was going on on the road then if I was just steerign myself around it would be a whole lot easier.

Driverless cars are a good thing, and a bad thing. If everyone had a driverless car it would be more easy to drive and faster, but people would become lazy. People would have to drive and be more cautiuos of what is around them. I think that it would be smarter if everyone had to drive and steer the car because it would be good to keep people focused and more cautiuos. If people weren't able to drive a driverless car it would be better for the roads and for the people.",1.0

These growth parameters are useful for identifying unknown bacteria species in a mixed culture and determining the composition and proportions of bacteria in a sample. 

To study growth kinetics, bacteria are inoculated in a sterile growth medium and incubated at the optimal temperature for growth. The population size is measured over time by counting colony forming units on agar plates or using spectrophotometry to measure turbidity. Four phases of growth are typically observed: lag phase, exponential log phase, stationary phase, and death phase. 

In the lag phase, bacteria are acclimating to the new environment but not actively dividing. In the exponential phase, bacteria divide at a constant rate, and the population grows exponentially with time. The generation time, or time required for the population to double, can be calculated from the exponential growth rate. As nutrients deplete and waste products accumulate, growth slows and enters the stationary phase where birth and death rates stabilize at zero population growth. Finally, in the death phase, the death rate exceeds the birth rate, and the population declines.

To identify unknown bacteria in a mixed culture, growth kinetics can be determined for each species individually and compared to the mixed culture. Nine bacteria speciesEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogeneswere studied in isolated cultures. Growth was measured using spectrophotometry, and growth parameters were calculated for each species.

In the mixed culture, the growth curve showed a short lag phase, followed by an exponential phase growth rate of 0.42 hr1. Based on the generation times of the nine species, this growth rate matched E. coli, P. mirabilis, and S. epidermidis. In the stationary phase, the maximum population density was 1.3x109 cellsmL, matching the carrying capacities of E. coli and P. mirabilis. Microscopy and biochemical tests identified that the mixed culture contained mostly Gramnegative bacteria. From this, it can be concluded that the mixed culture predominantly contained E. coli and P. mirabilis, with a small amount of S. epidermidis.

In summary, studying growth kinetics of isolated bacteria species and comparing to a mixed culture can be used to determine the composition of unknown bacterial samples. By measuring parameters such as growth rate, generation time, and carrying capacity, individual species can be identified and their proportions in the overall population estimated. Culturing and staining methods provide further confirmation to characterize the bacterial composition. Growth kinetics provides a useful methodology for exploring bacterial growth and identifying microbes in environmental and clinical samples.",1.0

Carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid in the atmoshpere are another. In our article the author states it would be a very dangerous planet to explore to the point of near impossible. We can and should study this planet because we can expand our knowledge as a people, it is fascinating, and it might bring about better knowledge.

If humans were able to survive and live in these dangerous conditions we might find out even more about what our universe is capable of. One aspect of life on Venus is that we might be able to use the knowledge we find on this planet and use it to help us explore other worlds that we have not yet discovered. We can use this planent as something so new and strange that it will make people want to explore, research on, and study more. Scientists and people with this attitude could possibly find new discoveries that we don't even know are out there. Even though it seems dangerous there are so many benefits we might be able discover if we learn to cope.

This planet is very dangerous due to the weather. The atmosphere is carbon dioxide, at an 97 percent rate, and sulferic acid makes up 90 plus percent of the clouds that exist here. Carbon dioxide and sulfuric anciad are not exactly the least toxic of materials. These material can potentially be harmful to a species such as humans. However, not everything is harmfull. There are many good things to discover on Venus and many things that might make us want to explore. There are so many new discoveries made on that planet. From rock layers to valleys. There are so many things we don't know or will find out about Venus with the research that can be done now and the research that we can do.",1.0
e_t0er1vf8,5,"But with this technology, I feel like that would not be a good idea for teacher and student bonding, because then students would have a hard time trusting teachers because of the technology and if anything making student feel like they wont want to talk about there problems or anything at all because of the lack of trust that this technology gives them for teachers to figure out. If you want to know how the student is doing so badly then sit down and talk to the student about whats going on you should not need a device to detect what they are feeling. What would they gain from all that information how the students feel what is that suppose to do to make them happier making this sort of technology is a really big lack of privacy.

This would be very valuable to many students because it can detect how their feeling and if they're feeling down they can maybe talk to a teacher about it, or may just want to be left alone. This computer may also put people on the spot as to how their feeling, and may not to express themselves. This piece of technology might make people feel desprite of need to talk to someone anbout why they are feeling the way they are feeling.

This technololgy could help with many things in the future by getting rid of all the nonfun things that happen in classroom. If this technology was in high schools I think the way teachers teach thing now days would be way better. For example, when the author put the mini lesson about moving you face in different emothions that was a good lesson. Just from that I learn that just moving your face around in different emotion could make you feel like the face you just made.",0.0
e_9yjogfiq,5,"In recent years, more than ever, many students and teachers are seeking for new ways and methods to communicate with their peers. In fact, technology has been around for hundreds of years. New programs have been introduced to the world to ensure that every student receives the needed help. Fortunately for us, however, schools are starting to realize the importance of this kind of new technology. Students are able to do this by applying the Facial Action Coding System. This technology can detect emotions, even though they may not want to. This innovation will enhance the quality of lives of students and will allow for them to fully understand how the world is run and to create a happier, more educated society.

The Facial Action Coding system allows for a much simpler and less confusing method to be utilized. This will be valuable for schools because it will reduce the number of distractions that students face and will allow them to stay focused on their learning. This technology will improve the quality of learning for all students, by giving them a better education. This will also change the perception of school for students who aren't comfortable with the educational system.

This technology is very valuable to students because it is able to scan and analyze the emotional expressions of students in a way never before possible. The classroom computer is equipped to recognize when the student is bored, confused, or bored. However, if they are using a computer to read their emotions, it will help students be more effective. Students will know when to stop them from being frustrated andor scared. They won't be distracted by the screen. Instead, they can be focused on the content of the lesson, where they will learn what they need to improve on. With the ability to control how their lesson is interpreted, teachers will be able to prepare the students well for school in the future. It is important to implement the Facial Action Coding System to create an environment that is valuable to the education of students. With the ability to monitor emotions, this revolutionary invention will allow for students to learn and adjust to their emotions and, therefore, will help students in their learning environment. With this advanced technology, people may become more willing to learn, and may even be more engaged with their online experience. ""When I first started out as a student, I was never really happy about it, but, now I'm happy"" 7. With the new implementation of this innovative software, students may feel less stressed, or less anxious, as well as having better understanding of their emotions, while being able to understand and learn more about themselves. 6. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable for the advancement of education and is able to help with students' emotional expressions. For example, a student could be confused and confused about the lesson and will not be able to learn if that is the case the student will take action on the problem and fix it, so they will know how to get rid of it or make it better. Then the teacher will give the students the appropriate instruction to help them become better in class, which will better their education and, in turn, their future jobs. Furthermore, with the implementation of this technology, students will have no problems with how teachers can design their own lessons for the best benefit of their student's education.

The implementation of this new technology may change the way humans perceive the world today. Dr. Huang states that they can detect emotions without ever having to take their own hands off of a computer, which may or may not be possible. This new and innovative software technology can be implemented in daily life to create new, beneficial experiences with students. With the ability to adapt and adapt to humans' needs, teachers can make lessons and lessons more enjoyable for both students and teachers, but also teachers. When students feel stressed about their emotions, this Facial Action Coding system may be useful in their classrooms.",0.7
e_f5qs730v,2,"The Face on Mars Controversy

While the intriguing outline of a face detected in images taken by NASA's Viking orbiter continues to inspire curiosity and debate, evidence persuasively indicates the landform is of natural origin rather than artificial construction. There are several compelling reasons to believe the socalled ""Face on Mars"" resulted from normal geological processes rather than alien intervention.

For one, the landform lacks distinguishing features one would expect of an intentionally constructed sculpture. It possesses only a vague resemblance to a human face, with no welldefined eyes, nose or mouth. Natural erosion over eons could easily produce ambiguous shapes that trick the human mind into perceiving faces where none exist. Additionally, similar contoured formations have been spotted elsewhere on Mars and other planets, supporting the idea that they arise naturally from environmental factors rather than intelligent design. 

A key piece of evidence is that high resolution images show the Face is an arrangement of basic landforms that fit within the area's geological context. It consists of mesas, cliffs and other terrain types common in the region's rock layers. The streaks running down its ""cheeks"" match the direction of prevailing winds and resemble patterns left by natural abrasion. Scientists have proposed processes like sapping and landsliding could naturally form the landform's irregular shape and texture over immense time periods.

Significantly, subsequent missions have revealed numerous other landforms on Mars that superficially resemble faces or objects, strengthening the case that such formations occur frequently without consciousness involved. The low probability that such a seemingly facelike arrangement would result from chance alone is offset by Mars' unimaginable age and surface area offering limitless opportunities for coincidence over billions of years. While still invoking our innate sense of patternrecognition, a natural origin for the Face remains the most scientifically reasoned conclusion based on the evidence available. While inspiration for imagination, it does not credibly signify alien visitation in our solar system's past.",1.0

In German suburbs, life continues on without cars, except in Bogota Colombia which is mostly known for being one of the most polluted place in the world. In Vauban, Germany people have given up their cars because with no cars then people don't have to spend money on gas, and Germany's streets will be safe without the cars messing up the roades and less car accidents will occur. Although it isn't a perfect solution to reduce the smog, they don't have to wake up early to go to work and no one needs to wait for that bus. It's only 5 minutes to walk away from a curb in the French and Swiss borders.

In Vauban, Germany residents are starting to act without cars, even with a carfree day. In Vauban, germany a suburb, is one of the most heavily populated cities in the world. The new, improved community, which is called ""Carfree"" cities are generally cleaner than other European capitals. In some countries, cars are allowed to be parked at home but they can't be used on the roads because of this new rule, ""car ownership is allowed, but only in certain areas in this enviroment permitted for the residents to own cars,"". That means that even if they want to not to use their cars at all, because people are not able to get to the destinations they need to go.

That means that the smog will have less of a effect in the next two weeks. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined during the first monday of school. Then they went back for more repairs and replaced the roads with new oneway bicycle paths. If we limit car use, we will see less traffic, and less money involved.. If people would violate this day they would get charged 25 fines. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" so doing this day it would make people more relaxed and happy but also be good to the enviroment just like in Germany.

e_38py4uax,0,"The reason i disagree is there should be a Carfree day. First people would be late to work. Second people might not have the money to pay for buses or taxi's. Last people might have to go some where urgent.

My first statment is people might be late to work. People are rushing to go somewhere urgent and they might need to get some supplies for the supplies they are missing and thats not fair to them. Also they wont be getting any money for food until the bus is finished or a taxi is picked up. They might even have to walk to the store. Or maybe they don't even get to work on time. But i think they should only drive if it is snowing.

Next People have to pay for buses or taxi's to go places. There are some cars that have GPS and you need to use them if you get lost or something, but you cant rely on it unless you're in a hurry. Getting busestaxi's are not always very cheap but they would take buses to go places in thirty minutes.

My last statement would be that people could have to go some where urgent. For example the bus may not be the fastest to be on time so you need to get somewhere before your late to go to work. Also you could be in the hospital and the ambulance would be out of town so they might have to walk a couple of steps away from your house. But some people do need help. Some people can help out by bringing them food, money, or food. Others might be too busy and they couldnt go because they had to call 911. That is the only thing people could do is stay after and take that bus.

In my conclusion people could be late to work. The bus isn't going to get them to the location. Finally people might not have the time to wait. It might be to hot to walk and the bus could get you there. So I think that we should have to limit car usage.",0.7
e_wyftj0g2,-3,"The main reason why we have extracurricular activities in our schools is so that we can meet outside the classroom in a safe and healthy way. If it was mandatory, that would have the effect of forcing all students to be there on the days they were allocated, even if they could be accommodated on the other days if funding was found. Moreover, since it would have been the teachers own time that had been earmarked for extracurricular activities, they would have to find other ways to spend the time they would otherwise have spent on these activities with children who did not participate. When it is free to take part and requires nothing but time, dedication, and skills, it should not require a major commitment of time and money from the parents. And it is not fair to either those children who take part in extracurricular activities at school or those who pay private tuition out of their own pockets and who are not allowed to go anywhere during school hours. It is not fair to expect parents to volunteer their time outside school hours in addition to the hours spent on curricular activities that would be impossible. If it is made mandatory, it takes priority over all other activities which we may think would be more useful for the education of our young people than extracurricular activities. One of the main reasons why people take up certain activities is to give them something to do for one hour a day that their parents or guardians may not be able to share with them. It is also necessary to be able to choose between various things so that during the period of adolescence they can lead a healthy personal life while developing into good citizens. The various groups would have to choose between the things their parents think they ought to do and those that they are good at or enjoy doing. An extracurricular activity of any kind that takes up school time and has the effect of being compulsory in our schools is ineffective and counterproductive, and would only harm its success. This should be part of the schooling process, irrespective of other demands and considerations.

e_83hej3ce,2,"Introduction

I was intrigued by the article you published about the Face on Mars. I read through the evidence and came to the conclusion that it is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

I would like to start by making a few claims that I think are supported by the evidence in the article. First, the Face on Mars is not a uniform shape. There are distinct features that can only be found on certain parts of the Face. Second, the Face is not a smooth surface. It has many small bumps and valleys that are not consistent with a natural formation.

Finally, the Face is not the only feature on Mars that has this appearance. There are other areas on Mars that are also exhibiting strange features that could only be created by nature. For example, there are giant canals on the surface of the planet that are similar in shape and size to the Face.

So, based on the evidence in the article and my own observations, I think it is safe to conclude that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Thank you for reading my essay and I hope you share my opinion.",1.0

We have only sent some space crafts and they didnt last more than an hour or two. The conditions on Venus are very extreme so it makes it hard to study. If you really think about what the text says then its kind of true, but if you look at the positives you will see why he thinks it would be worthwhile for us to study Venus further even with all of these challenges. In paragraph 8 it states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value"". This quote shows that even though it may be dangerous to try to learn new things and get into the unknown, it does still have value to us humans. Another quote from this passage is in paragraph 6 where it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" This means that the Earth used to look just like Venus which also gives us hope that maybe one day Mars could look like Venus now.

e_nqe1qubq,-2,"Mearsheimer justifies the reasons for Modern European war by the existence and disposition of poles of power, which affect the determination of states to engage in hostilities. He considers the multipolar system the most conducive to rivalry because states authority is not distributed evenly Mearsheimer, 2014. Furthermore, it is most predisposed to instability, as relations between countries change from hostile to sociable and vice versa. Such frequent transformations contribute to the constant emergence of wars. Moreover, they prevent a rational assessment of the capabilities and intentions of adversaries.
An unbalanced multipolarity is the most unbalanced form because it is characterized by a hegemon pursuing as much power as feasible. Other states are fearful of such urges, and therefore their policies can be more aggressive. Mearsheimer 2014 argues that wars in modern Europe under a bipolar order occurred with minimal frequency. This system is the most steady because there is a balance between the countries, contributing to their mutual understanding.
However, Mearsheimers concept cannot be applied nowadays because it is challenging to define the current world order. It is evident that multipolarity prevails and establishes the course of action. Still, it is closely intertwined with bipolarity, which indicates that the modern world is a unique system with dissimilar approaches and impacts. This connection distinguishes the current state of the world structure from the previous one. Therefore, one cannot associate the reasons for military conflicts solely with a specific system.
Mearsheimers ideas regarding the grounds for wars are rational and reasonable. Nevertheless, the author doubts them because of the nuclear weapon, which existed when Europe was bipolar Mearsheimer, 2014. It was not present in multipolar order, and therefore the arguments are not valid as the atomic weapon is one of the worlds most significant forces. Mearsheimer 2014 suggested that it, not the system, could be the foremost reason for the absence of war in bipolar Europe between 1990 and 1945. The balance of power cannot affect the outbreak of war as much as the fear of nuclear annihilation.",0.0

While students may be aware of their own weaknesses and design projects to help themselves learn, students may often get stuck during certain parts of the project. These situations would become a disadvantage to the students due to their lack of prior knowledge about making projects to maximize learning. On the other hand, these situations would become advantages to students if teachers designed the project and were able to help the students to minimize time spent being stuck on certain parts of the project. Summer projects should be teacherdesigned because teachers have sufficient experience with students in order to select the conditions for the project that are needed to help students learn during the summer, they would have sufficient knowledge about the project in order to quickly respond to student questions during the summer, and they can communicate with students and provide feedback in order to help students take maximum advantage of the summer project to learn.

Teachers have experience with students that would help them set conditons for the projects that would be beneficial for students to learn during the summer. For example, if students were required to report on historical events as part of a summer project and the teachers were aware that the students did not have enough experience finding credible sources, teachers would be able to provide a set of credible sources, such as textbooks and websites, that the students could use for their project. In this situation, teachers would be able to eliminate the need for students to find credible sources and students would be able to spend more time learning about the historical event they were reporting about. Teachers should design summer projects for students because they have the experience with students in order to anticipate and remove tasks that are irrelevant or detrimental to the learning of the students.

Teachers will be able to quickly answer questions related to the summer project, so that students minimize the time they spend being stuck on a certain part of the project. For example, if students were required to experiment on plants as part of a summer project, students could ask teachers about making the hypothesis or about conditions which the experiment should follow in order to achieve ideal results. In this situation, because the teachers designed the project, they would be able to anticipate these questions and provide the appropriate answers in order for students to complete the project. Teachers should be responsible for designing summer projects for students because they would have a better understanding of the project, and they would be able to quickly provide appropriate answers to student questions.

Teachers will be able to communicate with students more efficiently and provide meaningful feedback in order to help students take maximum advantage of the learning time during summer break. For example, if students were required to write an essay about a major theme in Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare, students could share their thesis statements with their teachers, and the teachers would be able to provide references to different part of the novel for students to improve their thesis statements. In this situation, communication between students and teachers will enable the students to learn more about the novel by incorparating more parts of the novel into their essays. Teachers should design summer projects because they would be able to communicate effectively with students and provide feedback that allows students to spend more time improving their projects.

It is necessary for teachers to design summer projects because set conditions that allow students to continue learning during the summer, they can provide better answers to student questions, and they can provide meaningful feedback to students. Teachers are crucial to the design of summer projects because of the skills and experience that they bring when designing projects to help students learn during the summer. Therefore, teachers should be required to design summer projects instead of students, which will improve student learning.",0.0
e_kbllfukl,1,"When people vote they are actually voting for the new president. In order to do this they want the people of the state and the states who are voting to change there voting methods to popular vote. The electoral college is not fair to citizens and should be taken out of use. When using popular vote instead of the electors people would be much more likely to place their votes in the right place and the way that the election should be run. Citizens are not voting for the president they want to vote for. That is not right, and they should be able to have some say in who is running their country. The election should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States.

The ""electoral college"" has been around since the Constitution was established and should be taken down. The process of voting should not be used again because its time to make a new election and change the voting methods to popular vote. They are the ones who vote for who should become president, not on who they thought was best for the united states. This is not what a person may think of if they do not pick who their president is, but also because they have to go through electors in order to ""get their votes"". If you put your vote into it and you don't know who you're voting for they could just go for it without having an actual say in who is the president.

People would have the right to vote on who they would like to represent them in office. It is not fair that the people will have to go through all that work to elect a president, we should be more aware of who we are voting for in order for the president to become the next president. They also stated that the electoral college is unfair in many different ways. One of the advantages to changing the election to popular vote is what we call a 'winner takes all' system. If the president were to win the popular vote but lost the presidency, why would he win? Well what is the point. We are the voters so we can decide who our presidents are, how they get elected, where they go, and many more. This is all i've found out about the electoral college.

If you voted for a specific person you would have the right to vote on him or her to have more power in their lives than the electors who are chosen. It is always better to just give the people what they believe should be their state's president. People can choose who they want to be President if we vote for what we think should represent them.

If the votes where to be reacted to and not the electors it would be more fair for the people who have no say in the matter. If the system was to be taken out of use and the people were to vote for who they think would represent our country well it would make peoples lives much more fair because we would have a say in the election. The way the electoral college was set up is unfair, outdated, and unfair to citizens. We should just give our citizens a say in everything and not just the votes in congress. We have the power to select who we would like to lead us. It is unfair that citizens dont vote for who they feel would represent them, but for people who do.

In conclusion changing the election method will be more efficent, less irrational and unfair to the citizens. People would rather go to their states than go through electors to select who should be their president in order to elect the person who they think would represent their state. The citizens would be happy with the result because they have more say and that is what they want to be do as president. So to end my argument I simply say think before you act and truly try to do whats right.",0.7
e_htkedx2f,-1,"How many of you guys can agree that no one likes to do projects, homework, etc over the summer, I know I hate it. Although sometimes it's required so we have to do them no matter what. Theres only one thing that can make it ten times worse then that which is when your teacher picks your project. I feel like summer projects wouldn't be as bad if students got to design there own projects instead of having the teacher choose it for them. If projects were designed by students they would most likely actually complete them the students most definitely wouldn't feel stressed or overwhelmed because they would be able to work at there own pace and lastly, students would enjoy it more the would probably put in more time and effort.

Most students turn in there work but we all know that theres that handful of students that don't like to turn in there work it could be because its too hard or they dont understand. How many times have students been able to do something for them self, projects almost never so teachers wouldn't really know how students might be doing other then the homework that they provide. If students got the chance to do there own thing teachers would certainly get more feed back to see where the kids are and what theyre good at and what theyre not so good at. Many students work at a different pace then others by allowing them to choose the way they want to do they're project would make it a loteasier and more fun for them. They'll be able to take it at theyre own pace and they will have more fun doing the project.

When students hear the words projects, test , etc they often feel stressed or overwhelmed. Teachers often don't see that, they just throw the work at them and expectthem to be done on time but they don't know how student often like to work. there are many ways that students work some students like to make or build stuff others just like to write or draw there are several ways people can work. Students also have a life outside of school teachers dont know what they go through at home if they have any problems going on or anything. I think in my best opinion that maybe once in a while students should get the opportunity to make there own work so teachers can reflect off of them. It's not just going to make it easier for the student as well as for the teachers theyll just have to grade the work while the students assign they're own work. teachers should always take this stuff in consideration.

It""s not super easy to be a student all of us have been there and we know what it's like. Students sometimes will turn in a paper or homework last minute and it's often turned in with half effort. some students dont try as much as others or at leastthey try but they have to much on there plate to balance. Other students have more advantages then others some have sports during the summer or camps or even jobs, these types of stuff are the things that could prevent them from having the necessary time to get all of there stuff done. If students didn't have so much going on in there lives now days all these projects and work would be so much more time manageable. If students had the time and resources that they need I trust that those projects wouldn't be effortless. The teachers are the only ones that can change that that way the students have more fun doing it they would also set aside more time and put in all the effort they got.

In conclusion these are the reasons why I think that students should get to design there own projects.

students would definitely get it done because they get to work at there own pace. They wouldn't feel as stressed or overwhelmed because they would be able to work in the specific way they feel is best for them. lastly they would enjoy doing they're projects because they would be able to balance everything out they would be more motivated to put more time and effort into there projects knowing that it can be done the way they'd prefer.",0.0

The new software is a compter that can know someones emotions just baseed off of one photo or painting. This technology could be used in many ways, like in security or even in marketing to see how people react to products. This could be helpful in many fields, but it also raises concerns. This technology could invade privacy if not handled properly. This also is a lake of privite life meaning that beacuse your computer is scanning your face to finger out your emotions it also have a copy of your face. Which could be used in ways you might not agree with.

The reason why I say dirveless cars are not the smartest idea is because if you have driveless cars everywhere there would be a higher chance of getting into an acccident than just you driving the car. This would likely happen because what happens if the system malfunctions on you and you are just there driving not knowing that the system isn't working, and then before you know BANG you hit another car.

Now, some people are saying ""well in the article it says that you need to be aware of you enviroment"" which in other words you need to know what is going on outside of your car. But, lets be real most people now and days don't really look at the road. They are texting or doing something while not looking on the road. So, what I am trying to say is driveless cars are not woth the wait nor the money. Most people in this world will probably be doing the same exact thing when you are the one drive the car.

e_c4j6n1ep,-1,"Dear principle,

I think people should do community service if they really want to because you cant force a student to do something that they don't want to do. But in my opinion i think people should do community service at least once or twice a week so we are not destroying earth. Because people don't want to help earth become a better place, then that's how we suffer pollution which is a really bad thing for earth, and community service helps earth stay in good shape and it also keeps earth healthy.

Some people don't want to do it because they think they have more important things to do like make earth even more worse or hang out with friends. But if they could just use 10 minutes of there time to make earth a better place then we wouldn't have to do community service. There are more ways people wouldn't have to do community service and that is to pick up your trash and not litter and that is a really good example for doing community service and not doing it. But people just have to have enough patience to do it, but no, they just don't want to get there hands dirty so that's why they don't want to do it.

But i say we should do community service, but not every day just maybe two times a week so that way people wont cry on how boring it is to do community service. Some people agree with me because they don't want earth to be a bad place. But some don't because they just don't want to do anything because they are lazy. I say that everyone in the school should get outside for five minutes and help clean up so they don't have to whine about how boring it is to take turns cleaning up after each other.

e_jzxxqlmy,-5,"Most students prefer working in groups to working alone for a plethora of reasons. Working in groups allows for a pooling of resources, including materials and data, as well as input and feedback. For complex tasks, pooling knowledge among various team members can provide enriched solutions that may not be possible when working alone. Furthermore, working in groups can allow for the division and delegation of responsibilities, which can significantly reduce the workload for each individual team member. However, working in groups can also present its own set of challenges. For example, coordinating schedules to meet for the project can be difficult, and individual personalities may present obstacles to collaboration and cohesion. 
Comparing and contrasting working in groups to working alone reveals both pros and cons. While working in groups has numerous benefits, it is not always the best choice for every situation. Working alone can provide the space to focus on a task and may allow quicker completion of a task however, it can be difficult to gather resources and data without additional help. Ultimately, its important to evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of working in groups or alone to determine which choice is best for completing the task successfully.",1.0
e_jqs2cnfp,-6,The idea and debates regarding the Face on Mars on the the Viking picture is an exciting and controversial idea. Although the popular culture sees the face as possible evidence of extraterrestrial civilization it is more probable to be just an interesting geological formation. With the high land picture and data made from NASA s Mars Mars Surveyor it is important to see the Face on Mars as nothing as just a naturally land phenomenon of a mesa. This is also many evidence and evidence for the way to understand the Face on Mars is a natural land or a alien artifact and it the the the the the evidence by NASA. The evidence and debate about the Face on Mars in the world of Mars is both interesting and contentious attracting both people of of life as well as skeptics. Although many conspiracy theorists argue for an artificial creation the most accepted geological understanding is that it is merely an ordinary geographical feature on the red planet called a mesa. Dr. Tony Phillips a renowned astrophysicist and researcher of Mars explains in his 2018 article that high resolution photos captured by NASA s Mars Global Surveyor in April 1989 proved the so called Face on Mars is only an impressive 3D illusion of a natural formation. The 1976 Viking images and data were very blurry and it made it seem more mystical than it was. Thus Dr. Tony Huang states that Shadows cast across this mesa formed an illusion of the face leading the people to think it it was a Egyptian and or face. Furthermore there are several other natural formations similar to the Face on Mars on the planet. Phillips adds that in the region known as the Cydonia region of Mars such geographical formations can easily be observed as a natural outcome. He explains these are just naturally formed formations which are not unusual to the Cydonia area of Mars and therefore do not require alien interference for their appearance. Phillips with NASA data states these mesa formations occur at the 1. 35 km altitude and their lengths vary between 3 to 5 km. Therefore it suggests a high likelihood that the Face is also a mesa formation with a 1. 35 km height and a similar 3 to 5 km long measurement like other naturally occurring features in that region. Moreover there was no accompanying body discovered in the same image or area and without it the existence of such a monument or statue as the Face on Mars seems improbable. This is also a significant indication that there is not aliens hidden in this area by NASA as it they have been. Thus it it is is the evidence that there is a alien life origin or something artificially placed on it. The Face on Mars was never hidden concealed or deliberately deceived by NASA the Face has been captured numerous times since 1976. After Mars Global Surveyor was launched in November 1975 it took nearly eighteen long years before a second high resolution and clearer image could be taken again of the region containing the Face which was finally captured on April 5 1989.,0.95

It s so crazy to think that a computer can tell if your sad or happy. if we use this in schools it could help teachers understand their students better. the possibilities are endless with this kind of technology. people might be able to communicate better if they understand each others emotions.

What I say is that the technology that we have today is not always what we need to find out about a simple smile or to feel what we see with our own eyes.

e_81m2g0du,0,"Have you ever wondered wha the advantages or disadvantages would be in not allowing car usage for certain time period. The advantages and disadvantges of limiting car usage can help reduce air polution by having less vehicles on the roads. There is also the advantage of not being in a hurry, and having less stress. Also not being in a rush will also allow you to have more space. And also less people dying in accidents.

To start off there are many advantages in limiting the usage of cars. And that will be that there wont be as many people dying in car accidents. The reason is because they won't have many car drivers to crash against. Also if you don't drive as often then there will be less people in the car, or the road that would need help, or that could get in an accident and get killed.

In the next paragraph I would like to tell you how having less vehicles on the roads will help in having less air polluntion. And in order to reduce air polutution the amount of cars on the streets should go down. Because having less vehicles on the roads will help the amount of car pollution go down because less cars equals less air polution. The more cars on the streets the more the pollution is going to go up because there will be more cars on the roads and more polution.

To finish of I would like to explain the advantages of less people being in a rush because less stress. If there was less cars on the roads, then there would be no people in a rush because there would be not as many people in the roads, so the people in the car would be in no rush because there would be nobody on their way. Also having less people in their cars and on the roads will help the air polluntion go down. And also having less car on the road would also help less people get injured or die in car accidents.

And those all are some of my ideas on what are the disadvanges and advantages in not having cars in a while. The advantage and disadvanges to having cars is that if the number of cars in the road decrease the air poluttion will also decrease, and less people would also be injured in the number of cars. Also the amount of cars in the roads will also cause less traffic.",1.0
e_u1v25cmg,-2,"NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank, on Monday named Peter Hall as the man to run its expanding operations but other questions over the bank's strategy remained, analysts said.
NatWest said Hall, who currently runs its American operations, would take over as chief operating officer of the investment bank, reporting to chief executive Martin Owen.
At the same time, NatWest Markets said it would streamline origination and distribution functions into one Global Financial Markets division from the current capital markets and treasury divisions.
NatWest said no job losses would result from the consolidation.
The bank has been on the acquisition trail recently, buying corporate finance boutique J O Hambro Magan in October, spending 590 million on U.S. primary dealer Greenwich Capital and 472 million pounds on Gartmore, the British fund manager. It also acquired U.S. merger and acquisitions specialist Gleacher for 135 million.
But analysts have expressed concern that NatWest will find it difficult to bring these all together, despite the fact that the businesses seem to compliment each other.
Some feel that NatWest is spending large amounts of cash on buying businesses that could be near the top of their business cycle.
""The NatWest markets business is robust and it can make returns while it is still building,"" said one analyst. ""But a revenue downturn will tend to hit the players who are building rather than those who are already established.""
Currently, investment banks are enjoying generally the lowinflation, steady growth conditions seen in many major economies with an accompanying healthy amount of mergers and acquisitions activity.
But a substantial downturn on Wall Street, predicted by many strategists, could leave some highcost acquisitions looking a little less appetizing, analysts say.
Owen said the fast growth of NatWest markets, both organically and by acquisition, had led him to the conclusion that the daytoday operational management should be separated from strategy, client development and financial supervision.
""As President and COO, Peter will be charged with implementing our operational plan, leaving me more time to work with global product heads to shape our strategies,"" Owen said.
Analysts were happy that NatWest had brought an insider to the job.
""Sometimes it gets difficult to keep continuity and things can start to fall apart,"" said one analyst. ""I would class this appointment as continuity, so that's good.",0.0
e_4w07a1l7,0,"Owning a vehicle or lisence is not what it used to be. Today, people all across the globe have given up driving for the many benefits that come along with alternative methods of transportation. These methods can reduce pollution, be cost effective, and even improve people's well being and happiness.

First of all, there is a surprising amount of options if you don't want to drive a car.

Public transportation such as trains and buses exist in most major cities, especially in America and Europe. San Francisco is a busy city with many young residents, and many of these residents are not interested in getting their liscenses. "". . . They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" Because so many options exists, many people don't feel the need to own a car anymore. Similarily, some cities and towns have been made specifically to be navigated by foot, like Vauban Germany. Towns like Vauban are tailored to fit its resident's needs in everyway. "". . . In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main streer, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" In Vauban, necessities are convieniently placed so that the town's inhabitents may acsess them with ease, rather than driving around the town.

However, alternative transportation methods are not the only reason to give up your car. By not driving a car, air pollution can be decreased drastically. In Paris, France's largest city and international destination, driving was temporarily illegal because of heavy smog in the city. "". . . Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" It did not take very long for traffic and smog to clear up once the ban was put in place, and the famous city began to look like itself once again.

e_766fgx3n,4,"The article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" is about how in the near future we will have driveless cars. Some may feel as if that's a waste of money and time because they are still very new to the world but this can be extremely helpful for people all around the world. This idea could change our lives forever.

One reason why I believe these driveless car are going to be big in the future is because of how safe they are. They come with many sensors which are used to help keep you out of danger at all times. The google car has used a special type of sensor on its roof, called LIDAR, that uses laser beamsto form a constantly updating 3D model of the surrounding environment. It helps the driver know where it is safe or not to drive through so heshe doesn't get into an accident. That just shows you how smart these cars really are. If only one small mistake was made by someone driving their own car, then thousands of dollars would be lost and possibly even someones life.

Another thing I find interesting about these cars is how much gas they use compared to your average car. For example, GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into something. There are also flashing lights on the windshield and other headsup displays. All these things require less fuel than most cars do today. With this being said, there won't be as much greenhouse gases released into the air from using these cars as well. Just think about all the pollution we release into the atmosphere everyday! These cars can make that stop happening.

Lastly, I think these cars should be legal everywhere in the United States and in every country too. In the beginning, manufacturers hope to do that by having incar entertainment and information systems that use headsup displays. By doing this it allows the driver to focus on the road while simultaneously watching the road ahead of them. Also if any work needs done while commuting somewhere then that could easily be accomplished without causing distracted driving. Not everyone can afford a house where they can go sit down at a desk and finish up some work they need to complete before leaving for work in the morning. Being able to multitask and do more work during the commute to work instead of sitting around waiting until you get home from work would be amazing.

These types of cars have come a long way since Google first created them back in 2009. The technology keeps getting better and better each day. Soon enough no one will want another old school car anymore because they know what kind of benefits they receive from these new ones.",0.9
e_bfnzuama,-2,"The sociologist Dick Hebdige argues that youth are often viewed as problematic in society due to moral panics and the threat that youth subcultures pose to social order. Hebdige discusses how the media frequently portray youth in a negative light by sensationalizing moral panics about emerging youth cultures. These moral panics tap into wider societal anxieties and fears about youth deviance, even when the actual threat posed by the subculture is minimal. The moral panics also fuel the process of negative labeling, where youth are stereotyped and judged as ""folk devils"" for their nonnormative appearances and behaviors.   

Hebdige examines the British punk subculture to demonstrate how moral panics emerge and negatively impact youth. In the mid1970s, the punk subculture arose in London, characterized by ripped clothes, punk fashion styles, and an antiestablishment ethos. The media quickly constructed a moral panic around punks, portraying them as threatening to society because of their radical selfexpression and rebellion against social norms. The Daily Mirror described punks as ""repulsive punk rock vandals"" and ""public enemy number one."" 

This moral panic tapped into wider fears about youth deviance and resistance to authority. However, the actual threat posed by punks was minimal. While some punks engaged in violence and property damage, most were nonviolent and simply trying to make a symbolic statement through their fashion and music. Nonetheless, the moral panic resulted in many punks facing harassment, humiliation, and violence. They were negatively labeled as ""deviants"" and ""folk devils"" simply due to their unconventional selfexpression.

Youth subcultures are often interpreted as problematic because they resist the dominant values and norms of society.  As Dick Hebdige argues, youth subcultures represent ""noise"" that interrupts the ""silent majority"" of normative consumer society. The spectacular styles of subcultures are seen as threatening because they visibly reject mainstream aesthetics and values. This is why moral panics frequently emerge around the emergence of new youth subcultures, as they are viewed as a symbolic threat to social order. 

The negative labeling of youth has serious consequences, as it can lead to a selffulfilling prophecy. When youth internalize the negative stereotypes that society assigns to them, it can shape their selfimage and influence their behavior to match these stereotypes. They may act out through crime or delinquency, confirming public fears about the threat they pose. Negative labels also justify more intensive policing and surveillance of youth, as well as more punitive responses to youth deviance. This can perpetuate a cycle of deviance as youth face discrimination and lack of opportunity.

In conclusion, Dick Hebdige provides a compelling argument that youth are often problematized in society through moral panics and negative stereotyping. Youth subcultures are frequently portrayed as threatening folk devils that jeopardize social order due to their rejection of mainstream values. However, these interpretations usually arise from wider societal fears and anxieties, rather than an objective assessment of the actual threat posed. The consequences of negative labeling include discrimination, lack of opportunity, and in some cases a turn to deviance. Overall, Hebdige highlights why youth are viewed as problematic and calls for more nuanced understandings of youth subcultures.",1.0
e_sgoihka3,2,"Here are the reasons that the ""Face on Mars""is not real. I will tell you why it is not real. We know that no human has ever lived on Mars as far as we know. That is what we belive. Everyone can see the ""Face on Mars ""different. It also variys on what each person thinks.

We here have had also weird land forms happen here on our own plant .Sometimes we see rockes even here that look like faces but we do not think they are human face's or an animal face's. Landforms can be sometimes surprising on how they form. They can look as if it was something when it really is nothing at all. That is what happened at Mars a landform formed and it got the shape of a face but we know that Mars has not had live of people on it yet of course .We also know that no human has gone to Mars or landed their to proove it is a face when we know it is not. No human has lived on Mars so how can we say it is a human face when NASA has done alot of reascearch that only people have lived on earth not on any other plant so far. People also know that aliens do not exsite. Landforms can sometimes counfuse us to think something else that does not even excite at all. But like always NASA well be doing more rescearch to show people it is just a normal landform that just some people think it is face but it is not.

Hopefully this essay has helped you to believe that the ""Face on Mars ""is not a face after all it is all just a story that you can either believe media and the people that told you that or the real resceacrch people that one day will show that it is just a landform. But for now some people think something else and other people think other things. NASA is the people you should believe not the media. Hopefully I have my point across this essay to the people that think it is a human face. I see why some people can think it is a face becaus eat first you can see the face. But no it is not a face. Face or not face we will one day see who is right the people that think it is a face or the people that do not think it is a face.

Sometime we can't say somethings at the most part , Because it's better not to let anyone know before people go crazy and go around asking a bunch of questions . The Face on Mars was discovered in 1976 , and by the time that has passed , it's easier to see how it actually looks . But of cource you can't just send someone out to space and actually see what's going on . It's not that easy to just do that . There could be some species that are out there somewhere and don't even know about it . A period of time we believed it might have been a alien artifact , but it doesn't look like an alien's face which is something we could be for sure about that . Seeing the picture that the  MOC  team revealing the photo of the face , people weren't so satisfied as they thought . The people must be thinking , "" There's something up in space , should we be clam or should it be best to be worried ? "" , that's what might have happens when people don't listen to what we say is best and do what they think is right .

But at the end of all this story and "" Oh it''s this "" or "" No , wait it's actually that

"" , it turns out that it is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or of the mesa . It's a common landforms around American West and it's the lava dome that formed an isolated mesa . Which is the same height as the "" Face on mars "" . Everything is perfectly fine , and everyone can be clam since we found out the actual and correct information and not just some random anwers that people were going around and saying about this .",0.0
e_p0h36eiz,5,"The new software that has been invented called the Facial Action Coding System, FACS for short is a technology that can read human emotion. The author of this article uses evidence to show how this software would be good in school and other places such as at work, home etc... However, I disagree with them because it isn't always appropriate or accurate enough to tell what someone is feeling when they are just around you, especially at school.

First off, having something like this at school wouldn't really help students learn more. Yes, it could help teachers know if their student wasn't getting a topic but still didn't want to ask for help, but other than that there really wouldn't be any other use. In paragraph 6, Dr Huang says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" which sounds interesting however, there are also many reasons why that is not true. What if a kid doesn't understand the concept of the subject heshe is learning about? Then, all of sudden, the teacher gets an email saying that so and so doesn't get it, then she might just think that her teaching style needs to change, even though she was doing absolutely fine before. A lot of times people don't get certain subjects because they haven't learned everything else yet. For example, a classmate may have never heard of the Pythagorean theorem, so when the teacher asks her if she knows what that means, she will say no and end up failing that whole quiz because she has nothing to base that on. That happens quite often too. Therefore, the reason why the computer thinks one person understands while another doesnt should be based solely on past test scores and grades.

Secondly, the software being used to detect emotions might not always be right. According to paragraph 4, Nick D'Alto states that ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This statement leads me into my next point. Let's say that your friend asked you how she looked today and you told her that she looks great. She smiles and laughs along side you until she finds out that someone took pictures of you guys talking without you knowing. All of a sudden, she changes her mood completely and starts crying. You look at the Facial Action Coding Sytem and it tells you that she is feeling happy and calm, and now she feels sad and angry. How do we know that that is wrong? It seems very unlikely considering the situation. So therefore, someones facial expression may not always match exactly how they feel inside.

Lastly, not everyone wants others to know what kind of day they had. Some days you wake up and your life is going amazing, but you have a bad headache and you need to take medicine that makes you drowsy. On those types of days, nobody wants anybody telling them that they look stressed. They just wanted to go through the day normally and keep their thoughts to themselves. The same thing goes for every single emotion that exists. People usually prefer to remain silent instead of discussing their problems to everybody who comes across them. We shouldn't be able to control somebody elses personal feelings.

In conclusion, using this type of technology to figure out peoples emotions isn't effective or useful. Using evidence from the passage, it is possible to come to the realization that this invention won't make us smarter, better, faster or stronger. It will only complicate things by making things harder to teach, confusing our opinions, and invading other peoples privacy. Even if we did decide to implement the technology into schools, offices, malls etc...it probably wouldn't work well anyway. We cannot depend on a machine to run our lives for us, humans need to live their own lives and find answers to situations on their own.",0.9
e_58qwxck7,1,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my view that the Electoral College system should be kept for electing the President of the United States. While changing to a popular vote system seems appealing in some ways, I believe the Electoral College has benefits worth preserving.

One criticism of the Electoral College is that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. However, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign across more states. It encourages a more geographically diverse contest rather than candidates solely focusing their efforts on only the biggest population centers. This helps give a voice to smaller states in the process. As discussed in the texts, without the Electoral College system, some states may feel ignored by presidential candidates. 

It could also be argued that changing to a popular vote would increase the influence of undecided voters in just a handful of swing states. However, the current system distributes power more evenly among states. Candidates have incentives to motivate voters in a wider variety of states under the Electoral College. 

While a popular vote may seem more straightforward, it also raises concerns about election security and reliability that are avoided under the Electoral College system. Verifying votes from every single eligible voter nationwide presents challenges not faced when votes are verified and counted at the state level first. Widespread claims of election irregularities could undermine faith in results under a popular vote.

In conclusion, while a popular vote seems simpler on the surface, the Electoral College system has benefits worth maintaining such as encouraging geographically diverse campaigns, giving smaller states more influence, and avoiding election security concerns of a nationwide popular vote. For these reasons, I believe the Electoral College is still the better system for electing the American president and should be kept in place. Thank you for your consideration of my views on this important issue.",1.0

Dear Senator's Name,

I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States, despite the calls for its abolition. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, strikes a balance between election by Congress and election by popular vote, ensuring fair representation and protecting the interests of all states.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcomes. The possibility of dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is significantly lower than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, due to the winnertakeall basis of awarding electoral votes. This system creates a clear victory and prevents elections from becoming uncertain and contentious.

Additionally, the Electoral College system ensures that every region is represented in the election process. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, necessitating candidates to have transregional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign across various states, preventing them from focusing solely on regions where they are already popular. By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of regions, the Electoral College guarantees that the President is perceived as representing the interests of the entire nation rather than just a particular region or group.

Moreover, the Electoral College system directs candidates to pay attention to swing states. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on states that are closely contested. This means that voters in swing states receive greater attention from candidates, leading to more informed and thoughtful decisionmaking. Swing state voters, being crucial in determining the outcome, are more likely to engage in the political process and make wellinformed choices.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not disadvantaged in the election process due to the apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College grants more weight to large states, as they have a larger number of electoral votes. This balance helps in offsetting the influence of small states, ensuring that presidential campaigns are not exclusively focused on states with larger populations. By providing a balanced distribution of attention, the Electoral College system promotes the interests of all states, regardless of their size.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This reduces the complexity and costs associated with runoff elections, allowing for a more efficient and decisive outcome. The Electoral College serves as a safeguard against prolonged election cycles without compromising the democratic nature of the process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system is unfair and outdated, I contend that it ensures fair representation, guarantees certainty of outcomes, encourages transregional appeal, protects swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. Preserving the Electoral College is essential in upholding democratic principles and protecting the interests of all states.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College system when making decisions that will impact our nation's electoral process.",1.0
e_7ca755ny,-1,"Dear Principal,

I do not agree with your idea of changing the school policy to have a B average to participate in sports. As you know right now the policy is a C average and i think that is a great grade average. I can see why you might want to change it, maybe its because kids would work harder and try to bring their grades up to a B, which would be a lot better and they would learn a lot more. But i don't think that that is a very great idea because, a lot of kids wouldn't make the team or they wouldn't get to play as much because their grades were not as high as they were suppose to be. I know some students that try really hard to get good grades but they just don't get school. So if this student was getting a C average and then he couldn't go out for sports then i think his self esteem would go down really low.

Also some kids might just be lazy and not even try out because they think it would be to much work to get a B average. If this was the case then your sports teams would start going down, your teams wouldn't be very good, and my guess would be that some students would just stop trying to get good grades because they don't see the reasons of why grades are important because he doesn't have anything to work to.

In our class there is around 30 students and about 23 of them do sports, and of that 23 my guess would be that around 1015 of the students that do sports have a C average, so if you were to change it to a B average then these students would not be able to do sports or they would just have to start working a lot harder. I know from experience that it is hard and stressful to get an A and some of these students think that it is stressful and hard to get a C.

This is why i think you should leave the grade average the way it is.",0.0

It is a privite right to drive but in america people are starting to stop buying cars and driving less. A new approach is taking the concept to ""car reduced"" communities. According to the burgeoning trend of car computing the united states is creating more and more places to park with public transportation.

a lot of people in bogota recieved there first car in 1890s when they had gotten there. but now they're not going to be using cars in the next couple of days. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gases so people dont have to use cars for work and they can use the public transportation system. and to make it better for the envirornment if it goes away its gonna take longer to go places. Besides the fact that some of the places are farther away and closer to walking to and other places that they don't walk. the people that are driving with there cars were not getting to work but i think it is just smog. there would be less polluted air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from tailes. some peolpe are worried that america might not be driving but its time to get used to drive less, because they feel like they know whats wrong with driving too much. that will help get rid of pollution so that's why I think we should be able to just go to the store because there wasting money money and money on gas.

Surely you're thinking ""What about the U.S.? They're one of the most powerful countries in the world they must have some insite on this new trend."" As a matter of fact they do. The U.S. has slowly started to take a break from the automobile. More and more of the new generations have decided to not get their driver's licenses. In most big cities in the U.S. such as New York most of their citizens do not own a car and rather just walk or use other transportation due to traffic. It can be easier just to walk somewhere rather than to sit in a car thats bascially parked due to such bad traffic. In other parts of the U.S., there is a new trend of carpooling which can not only have a positive impact on the enviroment but can also save you money. In paragraph 43, even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, agrees that less use of a car can have a positive impact.

In conclusion, people rely on cars every day of their lives. To get you to where you need to go, but if we continue to use cars every day and destroy the Earth then therewill be no where for us to go in the future. Polluting the air and causing car accidents and deaths is not what we need to be doing.

The fact is that if you limit car usage their will be less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When your done using your car, you might find something to be interesting. What if you find out something thats cool? you would be able to use it for a long time until you run out of gas. So next time your gonna need to take your cars to work for something you want to help out the earth and cut back on the usage of cars.",0.4199999999999999

 First of all, we are all different from everyone else, and being different is good for everyone. For example when you are in college, or in a job that you'll probably have to take some of those class or test. Isn't easy to change. Because when someone who has you, they are the type of person that can change you and that will change the way your living, for example, say ""I need to be the same person"" because they know that is how it works and they do the right thing to win the job. Those are just examples of how theres always something wrong, so when they see you working there and think you can be good and be like the rest of your family or friends they will start to think how good your parents would treat them. Thats why letting your own parents do it can bring good things in your life for you. It can take good care of people that have your back even when your just being lazy or just laying down on the couch and playing all day and not doing anything for yourself. But in my experience when I have had people who are always positive in life they have been doing it for years and still trying to keep me out of trouble and I think its good that they want others to see that thats what it means to have someone around you so they would not be scared to speak up in front of anyone or even bother to go to the bathroom so much because there is no one around to help or help you with your problems and problems you could even end up looking bad and having people judging you every time you talk or do things you dont even like.

e_3yyfute8,3,"Have you ever wanted to have an adventure of a lifetime, experience different cultures and see unique things? Then becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, just like Luke Bomberger did, might be the thing for you. Luke, a highschool graduate with no specific plans for his future joined the Seagoing Cowboys program in 1945. In this essay, I'm going to convince you to become a Seagoing Cowboy by explaining the reasons, benefits, and advantages it provides.
Luke was just 18 years old when he went on his first journey as a Seagoing Cowboy to Europe to aid warravaged countries. Being a Seagoing Cowboy doesn't only give you the privilege to help people affected by wars but also offers the opportunity to travel around the world, visit different places, experience new things, meet different people, and learn different cultures. This unique combination of helping humanity and experiencing the world's diversity is the primary reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke, for instance, had made 16 Atlantic Ocean crossings and two Pacific Ocean crossings during his tenure. He visited Greece, Italy, France, China, Panama Canal, and other incredible places.
Luke visited Greece when World War II ended. According to the article, Luke's most memorable visit in Greece was the Acropolis in Athens. He was fascinated by the architecture, history, and stories it told. It was indeed a sight to see after such a long and arduous journey. Similarly, Luke took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and marveled at a city built on water. He was amazed by the intricate and unique waterway systems. The fact that he saw all this in 1945, after World War II, gives an idea of how devastated Europe must have been at the time. But as a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke was fortunate enough to see Europe in its postwar state.
Furthermore, apart from experiencing different cultures, the Seagoing Cowboys program provides an opportunity to help humanity in their time of need. The cattleboat trips were designed to transport young horses, mules, and young cows across the Atlantic Ocean to the European countries in need. According to the article, ""the SS Charles W. Wooster, which Luke was aboard, had 305 horses and enough food and water to last them the trip to Greece. Imagine the impact of this program in Europe after the World War II. These horses, mules, and young cows became crucial assets to the countries affected.
Additionally, Luke, during his 16 trips, visited Panama Canal in 1946 on his way to China. Luke, with no previous knowledge of the Panama Canal, was left in awe. The Canal was an impressive achievement that connected the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. The Canal was 82 kilometers long and had three locks for ships to pass through. According to the article, ""Luke spent several days on the Pacific side of the Canal in a little coastal town. There he learned to fish."" This passage highlights the experiences and skills you gain while working on the program. Luke had an opportunity to see and experience the unique waterways of Europe to a magnificent feat of engineering.
Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is developing essential lifelong skills. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is not an easy job. You are responsible for animals' welfare and health.",1.0

It argues that slaves were counted as 35 of a person for the purpose of representation, and that the Electoral College is a direct descendant of that. It also argues that the Electoral College is not democratic because it gives more weight to some votes than others.

The second text, from The New York Times, makes the argument that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it gives more weight to some votes than others. It also argues that the Electoral College is not necessary because presidents can be elected without it.

I would like to address these two arguments. I do not agree that the Electoral College is a vestige of slavery, or that it is undemocratic. I think that the Electoral College is an important part of our democracy, and I think that it is necessary for electing presidents.

I think that the Electoral College is an important part of our democracy because it protects the rights of smaller states. The text from The Atlantic argues that the Electoral College gives more weight to some votes than others. This is true, but it is also democratic because it gives more weight to the votes of people in smaller states. The president is elected by the people, and the people in smaller states should have more say in who becomes president than the people in larger states.

I also think that the Electoral College is necessary for electing presidents. The text from The New York Times argues that presidents can be elected without it. I do not agree with this. I think that the Electoral College is necessary because it ensures that the president is elected by the people. The president is not elected by the people if the election is decided by the popular vote. The president is elected by the people if the election is decided by the Electoral College.

we should not keep the Electoral College because the Electoral College is a disaster waiting to happen.

""It has happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.

The Electoral College can also be a very good thing it can be good because it could tell us that we are voting for the president and not us. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" in his article "" What is the electoral college?"" in the fourth paragraph. It says "" In 2000, a te distict of electoral votes that the popular vote for President Obama had versus Romney in 2012's election. "" This oppinon is because almost all the presidental election is decided by the single representative from Wyoming..."" This means that we do not know who will be our next president if he does not have the majority vote of the people.

The Electoral College should stay because of it is the peoples way of choosing a president.In this quote it explains that the Electoral College is unfair to the voters because of it's winner takeall system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be removed from our voting. There are too many disasters going to happen. With it we should change it to popular vote for the president of the United States.",0.7
e_f8xdeclh,1,"The Electoral College has been around since the Constitution was established by the founding fathers. The question is, Is it time for it to go? I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, because changing the election by popular vote would not be wiser, and the Electoral College is fair for the people.

Changing the election by popular vote would not be smarter. Source 3 states, ""In 2012's election... Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" This source is arguing against the Electoral college, meaning they're trying to make a point on why it's not fair that Obama won with his 61.7 percent. The people vote for their electoral college, for their state. If the electoral college's votes are higher than the popular votes that means that the college is doing their job correctly. Source 3 also states, ""... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state."" This statement means that even if the popular and electoral votes are both high, the electoral vote wins, because majority rules. Just because the person running for office is popular, doesnt mean they should necessarily win. Electoral votes basically come from the people, and if the ""people"" choose a certain candidate, then that's who should win.

The Electoral College is fair to everyone. Source 2 states, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This method of choosing the president is completely and totally fair to the people. No, they're not directly choosing who the president is, but they have people to do it for them. As long as they cast in the right vote for the party that that candidate represents, then the Electoral college board should be filled with all the right people. Yes there is a possibility that the candidate someone votes for may not make it on the Electoral college board, but if the majority of the people are represnted, then that's all that matters. Source 3 states, ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that truth is barely betrayed... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person.

Eventhough some people think that the electoral college, should be no more, I strongly disagree, because the college is fair to the people because they represent the people and the college is a smart idea. The college works in everyone's favor. For those that disagree, there is always a strong chance that the candidate represented by the elctoral college will not win presidency.

In conclusion, the Electoral college is beneficial to the people and a wise idea. The people in the entire country are never going to unanimously agree on anything. Keeping the Electoral college is not only wise, but a safe way to ensure that voting doesn't go wrong, and that the people always get a fair say in government matters.",0.0
e_8sd7tpot,2,"If I worked at NASA and someone I know told me heshe beleive it was created by aliens I would tell that person to look at the facts. It shows in the picture and article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars"",""hugh rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."" While other people still think today that the picture was formed by aliens I have this to say.

""Why in the world will an alien was its time making a human face when they have never even seen a human before unless one came on earth."" In my point of view I personal do not belivie in aliens but I do belive that that ''face'' in Mars was a hoax. Like I said before I know that that face is a mountain that was accidental formed to created a human mask face. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. "" That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.""

The mask itself is nautural formed the shadows just happenedly popped showed up in those spots and here on Earth weird things happen but does not mean that an alien did it. The fact, the edivence is all showed in the article and picture that it was a rockmountain that formed a mask face if a human.",0.0
e_nz21vyq8,4,"Driverless cars? It seems to be a major advancement in technology, but what's the purpose? In all honesty, it is a very cool idea. This idea though, has a lot of thinking to go behind it. Is it necessary? What about the safety issues? How is this going to help the environment, safety of others, driving issues, fuel usage, and many other things? In this essay, I have many things to discuss and question as to why the development of driverless cars don't seem like something necessary to fund.

In my eyes, cars are some of the coolest things ever made. I consider myself to be a ""car guy"" if you will. I have had a passion for cars since I was a little boy and I have always liked the idea of going fast and making the car faster. Driverless cars, in my eyes, are like taking the racer out of an INDY Car. Who is going to replace that skilled racer? Sure, we have the technology for it but is it really necessary? Excluding calculators for math answers and Google for searching up history, I would rather put myself behind the wheel of a car rather than a computer. I trust myself to drive an interstate more than I do a computer to do it for me. A computer doesn't have the same reflex skills as a human would. If another driver swerves in front of me while driving, am I going to have a better chance of dodging them quicker than the computer and cameras would? I believe you can't always depend on technology to save you. Sometimes you have to take it into your own hands. Personally, I believe that driving a car myself is more enjoyable than someone or something doing it for me. I have always wanted to experience the rush and adrenaline of driving a Top Fuel Dragster at the NRA. If I had the opportunity, I would never let a computer do that for me. There are many people who think this way as well.

Another issue with this technology is the safety of it. As I stated in the last paragraph, who is going to dodge a swerving car faster the computer, or me? If I'm paying attention then I have a much better chance of doing it quicker than the computer. What if it malfunctions? No technology ever invented is foolproof or issue free. At some point in time, something breaks, needs replaced, or just gets too old. It's the same thing with original car parts as well. Everything gets old and needs replaced at some point in time. What am I to do if my driverless car malfunctions on the road? Safety is always a major concern.

I agree that there a many pros to go along with the Driverless Car. But with most pros, there is a con to go with it. A pro of the driverless car would be the stress relief. Technology is something that makes life easier. But the con is that you can't always depend on technology to work 247. Another pro would be simply how amazing it is that a car is actually driving itself. The con for this is the actual cost. How much will this technology cost to develop? The economy is always changing paces and it isn't always possible for everyone to own the fastest and greatest technology. I'm also very sure that the maintenance and repair cost of something like this would be through the roof just like any other technological advancement.

In conclusion, I disagree with the production of the driverless car. I believe it takes away the joy of the ride, along with the safety of it as well. The human factor of the driving machine will always play a vital role in everyday transportation. The human could be the deciding factor between safety and reliability.",0.0
e_o5accmpg,2,"Face on Mars: A Natural Landform

The Face on Mars is a fascinating yet controversial topic. It has been suggested that it is a created by aliens, however, there is evidence to suggest that it is just a natural landform. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" presents a comprehensive analysis of the data and research conducted on the Face. In this essay, we will discuss the findings presented in the article and conclude that the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform.

The article claims that the Face on Mars is a natural landform and argues that it matches the topography of the Cydonia region. It also states that the Face is too large to be constructed by humans and that there is no evidence of any construction on Mars. The article also mentions that the surface of Mars is covered in craters, which suggests that it is not a constructed object. 

The evidence presented in the article includes satellite images, aerial photographs, and data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not an artificial structure. For instance, the article states that the satellite images and aerial photographs show that the Face on Mars has a symmetrical outline and resembles other volcanic formations on Mars. It also states that the data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter suggest that the Face on Mars has a porous structure and is made up of the same materials as other volcanic formations on Mars. 

In conclusion, the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" presents a strong argument that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. The evidence presented in the article, including satellite images, aerial photographs, and data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, suggests that the Face on Mars is a natural formation and not an artificial structure. While the existence of the Face on Mars may still be a mystery, the evidence provided in the article helps us understand that it is just a coincidence and not the result of extraterrestrial life.",1.0
e_fxs27kbl,1,"What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by electoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter.Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win.When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good.You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe.

In the other hand,voting by Electoral College benefited us.Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. according to the last article ""In 2012's election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney...."" That means their votes helped Obama win. also the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done.

To summarise my reasonnings Electoral College votes should be change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier.Without happy people the country would be upside down.",0.0
e_151fml21,0,"All over the world, major cities are trying to reduce their use of cars. From Germany, to France, to Columbia, and coming back to the US, people are limiting car use to reduce pollution, or live better, or even to save money. In some places, there is one day every year that doesn't allow cars. In other places, there are whole communities that dont allow cars year round.

In Germany, there is a community in named Vauban that doesnt allow cars unless you have the money to pay for a parking spot that is on the outskirts of town. The revolutionizing community makes peopl epay 40, 000 dollars just for one parking spot. This wonderful new place has reduced the amount of greenhouse gas produced in the last few years drastically, with 70% of the population not owning a car. This has encouraged many other countries to start somehting just like it.

The city of love may not be so lovely if it's so smoggy you can barely see. Paris was gaining so much air pollution from the amount of gas that was released from driving hta tthey put a ban on driving. This ban consisted of a few new rules to help prevent the smog from overpowering the beauty of the city. On Mondays, even numbered license plates were not allowed to use theie car for anything. This same rule applied to the odd numbered license plates on Tuesdays. This helped limit the amount of driving, in return limiting the amount of smog. Smog is created when the area has cold night weather and warm day weather, causing the air to trap car emission. Diesel can be a big contributer to this and is the main gas type in France. France favors diesel because of their taxing system, but it seems they don't care too much about their environment.

What would happen if every country had a day with no cars? The city of Bogota, Columbia has had a Day without cars once a year for quite a few years. Just recently, other Colubian cities have joined in and even Paraguay's captial has participated. What this day is supposed to do is promote the use of other types of transportation, for example walking or biking. It also reduces smog and the amount of air pollution, in retalliation, improving the city. In Bogota, there is a 25 fine for those who do not participate in thsi environtmentally helpful day.

Although the amount of driving in the US has decreased since 2005, there is more we can do to help the situation. The average number of miles driven did peak in 2005 and drop from there, in return, dropping other statistics as well. As of April of 2013, the number of driven miles has dropped 9% below the peak, being the same as in January of 1995, says Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. The roads have even become safer due to the amount of young drivers dropping 23% between the years of 20012009. Even if the number of miles hadn't peaked, there still wouldn't be as many drivers on the road because of the recession. Americans couldn't afford to but cars due to the amount of money lost during that horrible time.

All through the world, people are trying to slowly save their environment by reducung car use. From one day to a whole year, everything helps to save our world. The German community of Vauban has made it nearly impossible to own a car. Paris, at one point, had to put restrictions on their driving. Columbia has an annual day of no cars. The US is working on lowering thier use of cars and dropping their average miles to help clear the air surrounding them. Even if it is walking from point A to point B, it helps the community and lowers air pollution.",0.0
e_cgt1ma7p,4,"I am in favor of the development of driverless cars because they offer potential benefits that outweigh the potential risks.

First and foremost, driverless cars could reduce the number of accidents on our roads. In a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, it was found that even with current technology, driverless cars could reduce the number of accidents by as much as 90%. While there may be some bumps in the road ahead as we learn to trust these cars completely to operate without a human driver, the potential benefits of reducing accidents are too great to ignore.

Driverless cars could also slash the amount of time people spend commuting. A study by the University of Michigan found that if driverless cars became common, the average American would spend about thirtyseven hours a year commuting, instead of the current fiftynine hours. Thats almost five whole hours a week that we could be spending doing something else! Plus, driverless cars could help reduce traffic congestion on our roads, which would be a major boon.

But perhaps the most significant potential benefit of driverless cars is their ability to reduce the number of deaths on our roads. The National Academy of Sciences study found that driverless cars could save up to ninetysix lives per year. Thats more than five lives saved per day! Considering the tens of thousands of people who die on our roads every year, driverless cars hold the potential to make a major impact.

So in conclusion, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks, and I support their development.",1.0

e_1emil850,2,"In my opinion I think that this ""Face on Mars"" is a landform. For one, we have never seen an alien or have 1 piece of evedince to say that aliens even excist. Secondly, the Face on Mars is located in the region of Cydonia. Lastly, we have taken more and more pictures and have never see any sign of life on any planet or on Mars.

First, we have never seen an alien and ive done my reserach on aliens and there is no way that there even exists. In paragraph 7 it says,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Which means if there was a sign of life on the planet Mars then we would most definitely see it.

Secondly, Cydonia is located in region of Mars and if there was any kind of life on any plant then there would be some evedince or signs of it.

Lastly, we have taken more and more pictures and we have never seen any evedince of life on any planet or that there is any life on Mars. In paragraph 11 it says,""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" which proved that there are no signs or proof that there was any life on Mars.

In conclusion my thoughts are that the Face on Mars is a landform because we don't have any proof that there are signs of life on Mars. So next time you see something that looks like a face, just realize it's just a landform.",1.0
e_yrdyahsz,0,"In the world today you will see cars just about everywhere, whether it be a toyota pirus, or an 1999 honda civic. Car no doubly have been one of the largest, if not, the greatest inventions this world has ever seen. Although nowadays when we start to talk negativially about the car, people seem to turn their heads away to avoid the question. Reducing the use of cars in the world would be massively beneficial to the environmet, and not only that, everyday life. Limiting car usage will help reduce pollution into the atmosphere through reducing carbon emissions, it will help save money and also it will help reduce stress and tense mindset.

One of the lrgest benefits of reducing car usage in the world is the reduction of greenhouse gases being released in to the atmosphere coming out the exhaust pipes of cars. According In German Suburb, Life Goes on Cars to 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions in the Unied come from cars in car congested areas. In the the text explains a social experiment turned into a growing trend in Europe today. In suburban town of Vauban, many people utitmatly given up their cars. How this was done you may ask? In the town diveways are forbidden swell as home garages. Car Ownership isnt forbidden though,but to own a car is quite difficult and costly. With only two places to park in the whole town, it makes ownership very difficult. The lifestyle of people here without cars ultimately reduced stress and increased heath, and much happier and healthier lifestyles were made. Another example will be in Paris, France. After the city reeived near recordbreaking pollution in the air, Paris officials took action. They banned driving for two days to attempt to reduce carbon emissions. The way they enforced this rule was by fines throughout the city for no cooperation. On that monday on the first day of the ban, only 4000 fines were given. Many people were complained of inconvience and companies complained of lost revenue, Although the incovencies, the ban for just one day reduced the smog almost completely and allowed for Pairs to lift the scheduled ban on that tuesday. So even though in some places the reduction of car usage may cause incoviece, the reduction carbon emissions cant go unnoticed, and it is huge advantage.

Reduction of the usage of cars will not only reduce Greenhouse gases but it also help people conserve and save money and stay stress free. Limiting car usage will save money a couple ways, which is not having to fuel up your car to save money. Fuel pices are always moving up and down, but more recently they have been very high. For many people they are spending over 50 dollars at the pump just to dirve 50 or so mles. With reduction of car usage people wont have to spend as much money at the pump. Reduction of car usage will also help reduce spending money because it wont allow to buy things at certain stores that you have to drive too, and things like that. Another advantage of the reduction of the usage of the car is the reduce in stress for a person. In town of Vauban, Heidrun Waltert said, ""When I had a car, i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" This way he mean the way without a car.",0.0
e_jtrr31zg,-5,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Staying true to oneself and persevering despite setbacks is super important. Like, really important. I mean, think about it. If you're true to yourself, you're not gonna be like, you know, a total fake or anything. And if you persevere, you're gonna be way more successful in the long run.

First of all, staying true to yourself means being honest and authentic. You're not gonna be trying to be someone you're not, which is totally exhausting. And it's also way more fun to be yourself, 'cause you can be like, ""Hey, I'm just being real here!"" And people are gonna be like, ""Yeah, that's so cool!""

But persevering is also really important. Like, when things get tough, you're not gonna give up. You're gonna keep going, even when it's hard. And that's when the real growth happens. Like, if you're in a math class and you're struggling with fractions, you're not gonna be like, ""Oh, I give up."" You're gonna keep practicing and stuff, and eventually you're gonna get it. And then you're gonna be like, ""Whoa, I'm so glad I didn't give up!""

So, like, staying true to yourself and persevering despite setbacks is basically the key to success. It's like, the more you're true to yourself and keep going, the more you're gonna achieve your goals. And it's way more fun that way too. You're not gonna be like, ""Ugh, I'm so tired of being me."" You're gonna be like, ""Yessss, I'm so glad I didn't give up!""

In conclusion, staying true to oneself and persevering despite setbacks is super duper important. It's like, the ultimate way to achieve your dreams and be happy.",1.0
e_fmnwtz9n,0,"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions Rosenthal 34. Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizarre due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. genetically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.Rosenthal 6"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States Rosenthal 5"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied carfree day in Bogota, and he stated ""rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic28"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress...Selsky 24"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris Duffer 14. Heidrun Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health Rosenthal 43. You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation.

e_rkvu4id8,-3,"The disadvantages of all these methods being weighed up, the resulting promise of the most promising projects was found to be those conceived by the students themselves. When teachers were responsible for devising summerschool projects, they could plan their activities around the school syllabus, which in this way they were able to fill gaps in the knowledge of the students. But such projects also tended to be rather limited, for the reason that parents, teachers and students all have different preferences. Besides, by involving the students in the planning, learning became more interesting. The more a project was the more likely it was to be creative and to be more organic. Moreover, it is difficult to get such projects to meet the interests and needs of the individual students, which could result in the summerschool being less inspiring. This could result in such projects being rather allencompassing, a multifarious concerto. When the youngsters are involved in such projects, choosing topics which they consider worth exploring, it gives the opportunity to develop their own insights and also to deepen the understanding between the teacher and the students. And it is also possible, if sufficient time is taken to consider the individual needs of the students when the project is being planned, to make a shift towards taking up a task from within the task itself. Learning strategies and working styles which best suit the individual students can be included in the planning. However, it must be said that stringent control of the system in future would be necessary. And this could result in the need for such controls being influenced by what we were taught, the goals set by the authorities. But the success of such projects depended largely on the mood of the students or their parents at the time of the project. In conclusion, both projects devised by the teacher and those devised by the students could be effective in encouraging continued involvement in learning during the school holidays. All these esoteric reasons considered, I consider that projects conceived by the students themselves would be the best way of encouraging the youngsters to take up activities which would contribute to a lifelong learning process. Having considered these alternatives, we can now choose the one which best matches our own and the youngsters mutually sensible goals. And from this we can determine what we should do about fostering a productive relationship between teacher and students.",1.0
e_7vfbaftu,4,"Driverless cars are a work in progress and would be extremely unsafe to use because of malfunctions, laws, and safety.

To start off with, driverless cars are not a sure thing and are still being worked on.

Google has been working on the idea since 2009 and hasn't even gotten it right yet!

In paragraph 2, it states ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are truly driverless.""

If driverless cars were to be on the streets today, they would most likely not even be fully tested.

Google's cars still have to notify the driver to take over when they are going to need the driver to steer the car.

Google also has had some malfunctions.

In paragraph 7, it states ""In fact, the car isn't truly driverlessit still alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or an accident.""

In 2013, the BMW was tested for driverless capabilities and the car was not ready for the roads.

BMW's car was not completely driverless.

Google had to make sure the car was safe before releasing it.

Laws have also come into effect because of driverless cars.

Google had to make their cars ""legal to drive in California.""

They had to make laws with their states to keep them legal so they didn't get in trouble.

In paragraph 9, Google had to get their cars approved so they could use them on the roads.

It also says in paragraph 9,""Their cars aren't truly driverless, which is a good thing.""

So in order to make sure the drivers in the state are safe, they need to have the cars approved before using them.

Drivers in Califronia are safe because they are approved.

Drivers in California have been on the road since 2013 so they should be safe.

Safety for drivers and pedestrians is the main reason for making driverless cars.

The goal is to make the roads safer for people to walk and to drive by.

Google believes that the future is going to have driverless cars but the future isn't going to be here anytime soon.

Driverless cars are dangerous because of malfuntions, laws, and safety.

Driverless cars will make driving much more unsafe if they are to come onto the streets now.

e_p3hvajc6,-5,"I think that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. They help create a sense of unity and equality among students, and can also help reduce distractions in the classroom. For example, if everyone is wearing the same type of clothing, it eliminates the possibility of students feeling left out or embarrassed because of what they are wearing. Additionally, dress codes can also help prevent bullying and social conflicts, as students are not able to express their individuality through clothing. This can create a more harmonious and focused learning environment.

On the other hand, dress codes can also be seen as restrictive and limiting. Some students may feel that they are being denied the opportunity to express themselves, which can be detrimental to their selfesteem and creativity. Furthermore, dress codes can also be difficult to enforce, as students may find ways to circumvent the rules. This can lead to a sense of rebellion and disrespect towards authority.

In conclusion, while dress codes can be beneficial in creating a positive learning environment, they can also be seen as restrictive and limiting. It is important for schools to find a balance between creating a sense of unity and equality, while also allowing students to express themselves and maintain their individuality.",1.0

However, the question arises on the effectivenesi and value of applying FACS in educational institutions. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of using this technology, as well as its impact on the privacy and practical aspects of education.

The use of FACS technology is valuabee for studenas in a classroom for several reasons. First . it can help a computer understand the emotional state of a student, such as when they are confused or bored. In a classroom setting, a computer could recognize these emotions and modify its approach to teaching accordingly, acting like an effective instructor. With computers now capable of interpreting the emotional expressions of students during their learning process, they can help students gain a better understanding of difficuet or confusing topics, ultimately leading to improved learning outcomes.

The author describes how the FACS is a very good way to tell the real expresiions of people. When someone is trying to show emotions they would show different degrees of expression to each person that they have showing. For example if people ohow anger they show their emotions by the look on there face. By showing anger there will be less angry and more happy faces and no more angry or suprise so they can look more into the picture.

In today's fastpaced world, emotioni can often be a difficult thing to navigate.

e_tmchtxx0,-2,"Introduction:
Cultural relativism, as a fundamental principle of anthropological ethics, asserts that every culture should be understood and judged within the context of its own values and beliefs. Applying this concept to arranged marriages prompts a nuanced examination of the practice, considering both its merits and potential drawbacks. This essay aims to explore the arguments for and against arranged marriages from a cultural relativist standpoint, highlighting cultural relativism as a valuable tool for approaching moral disagreements about cultural practices. However, it will also discuss the limitations and potential pitfalls of this concept.
Arguments for Arranged Marriages:
Advocates of arranged marriages often highlight several reasons that support the practice. Firstly, in cultures where arranged marriages are common, individuals may possess a deeprooted respect for tradition and familial bonds. The practice is viewed as a means to strengthen family ties, build alliances, and maintain communal solidarity. Secondly, proponents argue that arranged marriages provide stability and assurance, as the families involved often conduct thorough background checks and compatibility assessments. The emphasis on shared values, social standing, and financial security helps reduce the risk of potential conflicts.
Moreover, arranged marriages are defended as an effective way to prioritize longterm commitment and the sustainability of relationships. By involving families in the matchmaking process, it is believed that they can provide guidance and emotional support to the couple, increasing the chances of a successful union. The communal aspect also helps to ensure important interests such as the preservation of cultural and religious practices. Embracing cultural relativism allows us to appreciate the subjects of love and marriage in various cultural contexts, expanding our understanding of human diversity.
Arguments against Arranged Marriages:
Critics of arranged marriages argue that they infringe upon individual autonomy and freedom of choice. Arranging marriages without considering the will and consent of the individuals involved raises concerns about exploitation, particularly in cases where one party is forced into an unwanted marriage. Moreover, opponents argue that the role of gender inequality is often deeply embedded within the institution of arranged marriages, perpetuating oppressive gender norms. This could result in unequal power dynamics and limited personal development for individuals within the marriage.
Additionally, arranged marriages can limit the possibilities of love and romance, as they are based on compatibility assessed by external factors rather than the genuine emotional connection between the two individuals involved. Those who contest the practice assert that individuals should have the freedom to choose their life partners based on mutual affection, shared interests, and personal compatibility. This view promotes individualism and the primacy of personal freedom over collective cultural values.
Cultural Relativism as a Tool for Moral Disagreements:
Cultural relativism can effectively provide a framework to approach moral disagreements about cultural practices such as arranged marriages. By acknowledging that different cultures possess their own set of morals and values, we can foster greater understanding and respect for diverse perspectives. Understanding that our own cultural norms are not universally superior allows us to engage in productive dialogue rather than imposing our values on others.
Furthermore, cultural relativism enables us to evaluate the motivations behind cultural practices within their respective contexts. Instead of resorting to ethnocentric judgments, this approach encourages us to consider historical, economic, and social factors that contribute to the prevalence of arranged marriages. Understanding these factors enables a deeper appreciation for the complexity and diversity of human experiences across cultures.
Limitations and Potential Pitfalls of Cultural Relativism:
While cultural relativism can bridge the gap between conflicting moral values, it also has its limitations. The principle may unintentionally condone practices that violate fundamental human rights, such as forced marriages or child marriages. Cultural relativism can lead to a moral relativism where any cultural practice, regardless of its impact, is deemed acceptable as long as it originates from a specific culture. Striking a delicate balance between respecting cultural diversity and upholding universally recognized ethical principles can be challenging.
Conclusion:
In evaluating arranged marriages through the lens of cultural relativism, one must consider the arguments both for and against the practice. By embracing cultural relativism, we gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted reasons behind the perpetuation of this tradition. Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant in protecting universally recognized human rights, even within the realm of cultural diversity. Cultural relativism can be a valuable tool for fostering dialogue and understanding, but it should be tempered by a commitment to core ethical principles that transcend cultural boundaries.",1.0

e_s1u2vmsk,0,"Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage: An Analysis of Global Trends

With the increasing concerns surrounding climate change, pollution, global health, and an overall desire for more sustainable living, societies worldwide are reevaluating one of the most distinguishing aspects of modern life: car usage. This essay aims to discuss the potential advantages that limitation or even cessation of car usage can bring about by examining realworld examples from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France and Bogot, Colombia. 

In the German suburb of Vauban, Rosenthal 2009 gives us a glimpse of what a lowcar suburb can look like and how its residents thrive without individual vehicle dependence  a lifestyle that just might be the answer to the threat of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution worldwide. The measures taken in Vauban led to 70% of its population giving up car ownership. Furthermore, it shed light on an unexpected advantage: increased peace of mind. A resident confessed leading a much happier life without the constant stress of maintaining and using a car Rosenthal, 2009.

A partial ban enforced in Paris successfully decreased air pollution and respiratory health hazards by a significant measure, reducing congestion by 60% and bringing under control smog levels which had been akin to highly polluted cities like Beijing Duffer, 2014. However, its important to note the resistance faced by some, as seen in the case of 4000 drivers fined for violation of the ban, suggesting that behavioral and cultural shifts would be an essential part of this transformation.

In Colombia, carfree days have become a cardinal part of public policy, promoting alternative transportation methods, and reducing smog, while massively improving public health. The public participation, as seen in Bogota, suggests better acceptance of such policies, especially when bolstered with improvements in pedestrian spaces and community zones Selsky, 2002.

In the United States too, an interesting trend has emerged with newer generations driving less, buying fewer cars, and acquiring fewer licenses Rosenthal, 2013. This cultural shift is indicative of the potential for reduced carusage, especially when combined with effective policy measures. 

As we move ahead, it's crucial to understand the success of reduced carreliance isnt only about changing our transportation choices, but also about reconsidering how we envision our communities. All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change, said David Goldberg Rosenthal, 2009. The successful transformation of Vauban, the carfree days of Bogot, the temporary car ban in Paris, and America's changing driving trends all testify to the feasibility and tangible benefits of a reducedcar world. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not merely an environmental issue, but a pathway to sustainable living, improved public health, community building, and rejuvenation of urban spaces. Acceptance and implementation of this change would necessarily involve combined efforts from government, city planners, and citizens. The transition might pose challenges but the benefits are valuable and farreaching. Redefining mobility holds immense promise for our future.",1.0

e_7vy0oasp,6,"In this essay I am going to give you my reasons why I think that the author supports the idea of studying Venus, even despite the dangers it presents. He presents his idea that it is safe to view from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, the space crafts that have been sent to Venus aren't always safe, and lastly the spaceplanes are trying to get a good grasp on Venus because of all the things we are learning about Venus. He is trying to tell us about what we can learn and what they don't learn in class, but in the end, he is going to give us ideas on how to study Venus and explore more about it.

One reason the author supports the idea in paragraph one is that he says that it is simple to see from the distant, but also very challenging, when you try to get closer to it. This show that it is important to try to study about Venus, but dangerous. The author also says that we can study more about it by using a spaceship, or an object that can hover over Venus on its surface, so that the mission could last longer in order to get closer to it. This shows that he thinks that you should consider studying more of Venus and look into it closely. Another reason the author believes this is in paragraph one is because of the incredibly harsh atmosphere.

Another reason why the author supports this idea is because in paragraph two, ""Every mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, the author states that a spaceship would be able to hover over the planet about 25 miles above the surface."" This means that it is very hard to get close to Venus, especially if its close by. The author says that each mission was unmanned and because of the reasons he is giving, there is no need to go at all, to see what the dangers could be.

The last reason the author supports the idea in paragraph two is because of the high amount of poisonious gases in Venus's atmosphere. This shows when the author makes this statement he is saying ""It is too dangers to explore Venus."" He is showing us that Venus is a dangerous place because of the amount of carbon dioxide that has made it, and the pressure of sulfuric acid, which is harmful to us.

That concludes how the author says that studying Venus is very good to go to, but dangerous. I will also give you some details about each of those reasons. As I mentioned earlier, I think I have stated that he is trying to give us some facts that will convince us that it is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0.7

e_ix9mroeg,1,"I disagree with the fact that the state wants to keep favor of electoral college. I think they should change the way the whole election is set up by using popular vote for the president of the United States. To me the election should be based on what the people want and what they think is best not on electoral college. Electoral vote is also unfair to the people who vote because of the winnertakesall system is certain states.

Yes Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, bob dole, the u. s chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO agreed on electoral college, but electoral college is when the voters vote for the state electors who the vote for president. There is an argument called the disaster factor also and that's the single best argument against the electoral college. That's why popular vote for president is better than electoral because there is a better possibility of the majority of people winning.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it official !!!. Also, arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.",0.0
e_7xjssq46,1,"Dear Florida State Senator,

In the past century, a certain type of voting has been used for elections. The people should now know who to choose for president. We should change system so the president is chosen popular rather than the Electoral College. However, we cannot trust the people who we vote for to make it fair for When it comes to voting we must decide who our future president will be. Florida State Senator, you must abolish the Electoral College because tit is unfair that people aren't truly represented, the votes can be easily manipulated, and there is just an off chance that this will end up being undemocratic. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!

This method not democratic at all. The Electoral College is just the opposite of what the majority of the population wants. It was found by our founding fathers, the people of this country. The Electoral College was made on the belief that the government isn't really voting for who they want as President, but that is what they believe is best. Although, in source 2, it says that a winnertakeall process, it's not. This is an unfair vote because the electors can change their mind without giving their vote back to their state. However, according to Source 3, the electoral college makes sure that no state gets thrown off to the House of Representatives. A majority of people know that they're the ones who voting on who should be the new President of the U.S. If the election truly is based on for the president of the the electoral will have use its flawed system for deciding our president. method is not democratic at all.

For example, in the 2000 election, Barack Obama, the Democrat who was supposedly supposed to be representing a stateDemocrat in Wyoming, had their vote be counted to win the election by 51%. According to Source since Obama won the majority of voters in Florida, he was by 61% of citizens, and percent voters from voters voted for him instead. In 2000, popularity based on popularity on state went up 13%, which meant that if one candidate received more individual votes from the United this means that the ones who are going to choose his This means that the candidates aren't really for candidate they choose, but for a of the electoral electors who elect the president. In this scenario, the Electoral College is simply the process. Moreover, you may be wondering why this is not needed in your state. The people should have the right to express their vehicles, or in the case of an electionbut their votes still matter. This will allow the people's votes to count, compared to the majority of votes that they would have if they were picked by the House of Representatives. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.

Florida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the swing states to win the people's vote. People, however, from the nonswing states are generally ignored. According to the article of the Electoral College, voters vote for their candidate's electors, not their candidates Therefore, the people aren't actually voting for whoever the candidate wants as president. On the other hand, if the majority of our population did vote one candidate for president, then it will make it fair. For example, it has been shown that there are no people who support our democracy, and voters may not actually pay attention to their political views, such as the President Obama did in the 2000 election. The Electoral college isn't the least democratic in the sense of what we call it. It is, in theory, the best method of handling the presidency, and it is the way our president is selected. however, it is highly unlikey the whole country will vote for one candidate, or another. The Electoral College is just not democratic. In fact, this is completely true. There are people who support the electoral college, and oppose it, but they do not have enough votes. Their vote is in fact unconstitutional. The Electoral College is imperfect and undemocratic!

We need to use popular vote to truly vote for who our leader is. This method of voting, for the President of the United States, is less democratic and less corrupt than the other. If we are truly going to change this country's future of our greatness, we should use the Electoral College for its purposes. It is unfair, not democratic, and unjust to U.S. When it the time for a changeand if we're truly representing it, this nation will have the best leader in the country. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery.",0.7

What they should do is cut down the price for a lower cost so not everyone in the world is a multi millionaire. For example on passage 12 it states almost 4,000 drivers were fine according to Reuters . . . Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Thats easier to imagine than a car free Champs Elysees. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel was blamed sinced France has . . . a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up about 67 percent of cars in France which is a lot. The average of diesel engines in the rest of Europe is close to 53.

Paris typically experiences more smog than other European cities . . . Last year Paris had 180 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79 in London, Reuters found.

The smog cleared enough for the local French government to lift the ban on odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

e_7pebmomi,2,"Introduction:
As a scientist at NASA, I have had the privilege of studying the Face on Mars, a fascinating geological formation that has sparked the imagination of many. However, some people believe that this formation was created by aliens, and not a natural landform. In this essay, I will argue that the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform, using evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to support my claims.

Body:
One of the main claims supporting the idea that the Face is a natural landform is the fact that it is not unique. The article states that ""Cydonia's geological interest lies in its location at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, raising questions about Mars' past."" This suggests that the Face is just one of many geological formations in the area, and not a singular, artificial structure. Additionally, the article mentions that the Face was captured in a photo taken by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft 25 years ago, and since then, it has been studied extensively. If it were an artificial structure, created by aliens, it would be reasonable to assume that it would have been discovered and announced to the public by now.

Furthermore, the evidence from the Mars Global Surveyor, which photographed Cydonia in 1997, confirms that the Face is a natural landform. The images revealed that the Face is akin to Earth's buttes or mesas, which are also natural formations. Laser altimetry also confirmed its natural origins, similar to other Cydonian mesas. This evidence suggests that the Face is not a unique structure, but rather, one of many natural formations on Mars.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" suggests that the Face is a natural landform, and not a creation of aliens. Its similarity to other geological formations on Mars, its location at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, and the lack of any evidence suggesting it is an artificial structure, all support this conclusion. As a scientist at NASA, it is important to rely on evidence and scientific inquiry when studying the mysteries of our universe. The Face on Mars may not be a proof of alien life, but it remains an interesting and important geological formation that continues to inspire scientific curiosity and exploration.",1.0
e_s8bfvn0v,5,"Dr. haung and his colleagues are creators of the FACS Facial Action Coding System. They are from the University of Illinois. The FACS is a system that can detect different emotions from a persons facial expressions. This system is on a computer and it can identify if a person is happy or sad and many other emotions. The way the system can tell is by indentify the different muscles used for each facial expression.

This idea is very interesting to me. I find that the system has positives and negatives. Also there is nothing out in the world right now like it. I think that the FACS could be very helpful in some ways. The system can work in schools which would help the teachers know who is needing help and who isnt understanding the subject. It can also show what students might be feeling like that day and if a person should be trying to make their day better.

The sytsem can also help others know when someone could be depressed. Then the person could get the help they need right way and get it before it is to late. I also think this could help with bullying because other students will know if that person is relating to them or not. The students would maybe understanding one another more by knowing that they arent the only ones that are feeling the way they do.

The system also doesnt let people hide their emotions. This could be a good thing and a bad thing. Some people dont like to show their emotions and dont trust people enough to tell them what is going on. This system could be forcing people to say whats on their mind and they might not want anyone to know. On the other hand it might be good for them to get those feelings out and find help or have someone to talk to.

The FACS is still being worked on. It is a great and unique idea that has more positives that negatives. It would be very successful for many schools all over the country. The Faical Action Coding System in my opionion is going to help kids or teenagers more than adults. Overall i think this would be a good idea for schools to have.",0.0

In order to reduce the less effect of to the increasing number of cars the cars has be prescribed that all new roads must be designed by the and transport all new streets and which must be laid out by an allowance of public transport and reduce the amount that cars they be permitted to circulate. It is important however that the owners of the cars may have have to of their own car cars In order to save on costs of a cars. Everyone cars must use a cars. It is essential that we take steps to help our planet because by promoting a public transport system that gives priority to public transport we promote eco friendliness. This makes the amount to the car usage destroying cars are home to the monsters that are causing the.. The. cars has brought about the pollution of the car of cars because it needs enormous time of it and move. A study showed that greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by this cheap method of transport. This is something other nations should take into consideration when they design car free worlds integrating public transport with sustainable development. By reduce greenhouse gas emissions we would not need to build a whole a power station by a vehicle. The aim is to make people use their cars sparingly not for their own enjoyment but so that everyone can live a healthy and secure life. In Bogota and South America we are are wonderful car free zones such of pollution and traffic, but also have a lot to of pollution that use car free world. We could reduce the risk of cancer of heart and lung disease and of asthma. We would then be able to enjoy our lives without worrying about ourselves without being self conscious about our luxury. If cars there were an way to change this is changing the life we live. Such a way could be used by the country.

e_0tz07a99,1,"The Electorial College should be abbolished. Paragraph nine of The Indefensible Electoral Collede by Bradford Plumer states all the reasoning you would need.""According to the Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks yo the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The Electoral College is not fair and we do not like it. we should have the right to have our oppinion out there and not tweaked around by people we dont even know.

Why you ask do i feel this way? Well my answer would be in paragraph ten of Bradfords section. ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Thats not fair! As an american Citicin i have the right to vote and if my vote is not counted for, well thats just not right. If i do everything im suppose to but yet dont get to voice my opinion whats the point? That is why!

To sum it all up i will give you one final reason why the Electoral College should be abolished. Paragraph 13 of The Indefensible Electoral Cllege. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chnace of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" If i dont even get the chance to see who im voting for why should i even vote? If my opinion dosent even matter why should I care? The Electoral College is irrational. Its unfair, outdated, and it needs to be brought to an end.

Socan you explain to me how this is fair? Do you really thing that its okay to treat the american people like this? We are all equal through our freedon, tharefore we should be treated that way in every way. Thank you for your time.",0.0

The new software will help in many ways. One way is it will tell use if a student is okay. This will tell if they are making a fake smile to say that are fine, they really not. They could be having problems in there house or something like that.

The software can tell witch muscle is being used. That is how it know if its a fake smile or are a reall smile. This will tech the students a face muscle. It will help tham later on how to tell a reall smile or a fake smile.

Can the software upgrade? The students will proabley try to make it better. During the project they will learn stuff about the software. Later they will know what to do if it breaks or when they will creat a software.

I say that is a good idea to have tha soft ware. It helps the students learn stuff. it teach them about muscles they have in the face. It will give them experence on softwares. I think is a good ides to have one.",0.0
e_q5r8dwvs,4,"Driverless cars seem like a good idea, but I disagree. Driverless cars would just complicate issues rather resolve them. They aren't completly driverless yet, and they still need human drivers. They would only be driver less about fifty percent which means they are half safe.

The reason they aren't completly driverless is becuase they still have to signal to humans when they come to dangerous spots on roads like when backing into parking spaces or needing to get over to go around an accomblance. Which is still half safe becuase humans are not completly reliable.

They still aren't completly driver less becuase they still alert humans when dangerouous things happen such as needing to signal when coming up to an accomcation that can not by pass or needing to signal at a stoplamp.

e_4gvcltyq,-2,"Introduction:
Forensic investigations delve into the intricate details of a crime scene, seeking to expose the truth and bring justice to the forefront. Throughout history, advancements in forensic techniques have significantly contributed to the positive resolution of numerous cases. One such technique that has held immense significance is the analysis of indented writing. This essay explores the role of indented writing in forensic investigations and its crucial ability to unveil hidden information, shedding light on unsolved mysteries.
Body:
1. Definition and Process of Indented Writing Analysis:
Indented writing refers to impressions or indentations left on a document by the pressure applied while writing on a separate sheet of paper. Forensic experts employ various methods, such as electrostatic detection apparatus ESDA or oblique lighting, to retrieve indented writing. These techniques help enhance the readability of faint or obliterated impressions. Once recovered, these latent indentations can reveal invaluable information and provide key insights into a given investigation.
2. Uncovering Hidden Messages:
Indented writing plays a significant role in uncovering hidden messages that may have been altered or deliberately destroyed. For example, suicide notes or ransom letters may undergo fraudulent modifications through erasures, obliterations, or overwriting. By analyzing indented writing beneath the superficial layer, forensic experts can reveal the original content, unmasking crucial information that could aid in the identification of the perpetrator or motives behind the crime.
3. Corroborating Handwriting:
Comparative handwriting analysis has long been used to identify individuals and link them to a particular written document. Indented writing amplifies the possibilities of corroborating handwriting analyses. By comparing the impressions from indented writing with the visible writing on the surface of a document, forensic experts can establish authorship, forge connections between potential suspects, or disprove claims of innocence.
4. Chronological Reconstruction of Events:
Indented writing analysis can assist in chronologically reconstructing events related to a crime. By deciphering the sequence of impressions, experts can determine the order in which different documents were written or how additional pages may have been manipulated or added. This process can provide crucial insights into the progression of events or expose attempts to deceive investigators, ultimately aiding in solving complex cases.
5. Overcoming Challenging Document Alterations:
Forensic investigations often encounter cases where criminals intentionally alter or tamper with written documents to misleadingly shift blame or destroy evidence. Here, indented writing analysis acts as a powerful tool to restore original content that has been altered or obliterated. By discerning indented impressions, even when visible writing has been eradicated, forensic experts can circumvent the hurdles created by document tampering, ultimately uncovering the truth.
Conclusion:
Indented writing analysis plays a crucial role in forensic investigations by unearthing hidden information that is pivotal to solving crimes. By utilizing advanced techniques, forensic experts can recover latent impressions, revealing essential clues, insights, and connections that may have otherwise remained concealed. This attention to detail and commitment to extracting information from seemingly insignificant sources demonstrates the significance of indented writing in forensic investigations. As technology continues to advance, the role of indented writing analysis will likely evolve, further enhancing its potential as a formidable forensic tool.",1.0
e_w131jb2r,3,"Being a sea cow boy is an amazing experince, if you want to 1. see new places or 2. help out other countries. You'll also get to meet some amazing people along the way.

1. See new places:

You will go to alot of amazing places, one example is when Luke turned 18, his draft board told him to get a job and he found his job on a cattle boat. This is a good experience because you get to go to many countries. In Luke's case he went to Greece, China, and even to Venice. 2. Help out other countries:

In some cases you can get supplies, so you can help out in countries that are not doing good. In the text it says that in 1945 it was the end of WW2 in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. So UNRRA the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation hired the Seagoing Cowboys. You can also help out by donating stuff. It says in the text that you can donate things from China and get supplies from Greece. 3. Help out other countries:

It doesn't matter if you are a teenager or an adult you can help out. In the text it says that Luke helped his aunt Katie, he took care of all the animals on the farm. Luke also did this with his friend Don. This would also be a great thing to do for other people.

It's an amazing experince to do, you'll see alot of places, you'll help out others, and you'll meet alot of amazing people.",1.0

e_nhbwn6wh,6,"The planet Venus is the twin to Earth, it's just that Venus is not a great twin. This is because there's a thick atmosphere, and it includes sulfuric acid, the clouds are filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid making it hard to see anything from there. Another thing that would make it hard is that the average temperature is around 800 degrees Fahrenhent ,and you can't live in those conditions. Lastly is the planet's surface would crush a submarine and it's atmosphere is ninth and beyond what humans normally encounter, which makes it more than impossible to land on the planet.

Even thought we don't know that much about Venus, we still know that it has some features that are like Earth. This is because that planet is the closest analog to Earth. Another thing it has that is like this to Earths surface is the features of a rocky sediment surface with craters of valleys like what Earth has. Another thing it shares is the planet having familiar features like Valleys, but there's things it shares to. Also it has a crust that is of rocky sediment and some kind of volcanoes with hills and that it also have.

In paragraph 6 and 8, paragraph 5 has information on the atmospheric conditions on Venus and it's similar of what it had on Earth. It is also similar to how the rocky sediment crusts on Earth and Venus do and it is said that Venus has valleys and fumerae, that are similar to what Earth has.

Although Venus has a lot of negative things, it still has good things to it as well. They talk about how Venus in its past had oceans and there has to have been water since there's valleys and it is said that their was a lot of volcanoes. And the crust is rocky like Earth and there are lakes of acid that is like on Earth and Venus has rocks like on Earth. Even though its hard for NASA to put things on Venus ,it still is still a great planet for exploration and to learn about to it.",1.0
e_e2irzntc,5,"The use of Facial Acting Coding System would not be a practical idea in the future. They aren't worth the money that could be put into other projects around the world. If you're going to make a new invention that's very complex, its not practical. In the article it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That sentence alone shows that its not practical. It costs way to much money too create that type of device.

Using the Facial Action Coding System on everyday classes isn't going to be beneficial. It takes a way to much time to see if each person in your class is confused or bored. This could lead to a failure in education. If each student gets to see how bored they're getting, they wont want to learn anything. When people think it's a waste of time to learn, they're more likely to cheat. There are so many ways to get information out of students when they're interested.

A better thing to use technology on is teaching other countries on how to use computers. With this device they could tell people how to operate it, get them to use it for what it's suppose to be, and eventually get to where they need to be. This device could be used to help others to use technology more efficiently. It could help students learn how to work the computers more smoothly so that kids can keep up with their education.

In my personal opinion I dont think it woukd be beneficial to have this device to look at everyones expressions and try to determine what they're feeling. It takes too much time and money. It woukd take too long for someone to do this for everyone in their class and get their feelings. There are many other options for learning things and getting into education.",1.0

Yes Grayson they would lie about almost anything! Even NASA lied about the face they saw on mars being alien made because they needed funds. They know that funds come when theres a huge news break that involves NASA. They wouldnt lie about something big like that!

They said ""the formation was about the same height as The Egyptian Pryamids!"" But they couldnt tell wether it was acually made by aliens or just by a weird storm that happens ever once and a while there. It just so happened to look like an human face?! That doesnt prove them wrong!

The first reason the author supports the idea of studying Venus is because it used to be like the Earth. Venus had many characteristics that the Earth has like the oceans, valleys, mountains and craters. I know because in the textHe says, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various life forms, just like Earth.""

Another reason that the author supports the idea is because we can probably visit Venus, and the article states that ""in addition, remember that Venus can sometimes be our closest option for a planetary visit"".The author thinks that, once we learn more about Venus, we can probably visit it.

e_d9rm7hq9,2,"20 years ago something really cool happened to the face on Mars if you didn't know there was a face on Mars well it has been there for a very long time. NASA would have to find out what happened in 1976 Viking 1 had to snap a picture of the face because something looked weird they just figured it was shadows in the picture because there was a martian mesa it had a common form in some regions of the earth. Viking 2 went back to the face on mars in 1998 it was cloudy and they couldnt see it but after a few hours the clouds cleared it was a martian mesa just like before and they thought that the face was made up of shadows. NASA found evidence because of the picture that they found in 1976 it was the face that they had found in 1998 it had made a face and it wasnt just rocks on the mesa anymore and it also looked a little like a human face.

In 2001 they took another picture of the face the one they took looked as if there was no face there but the one in 1998 clearly showed the face. 1998 was the year to find out what it really look like because then they found out that it was an isolated mesa and it had some of the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The face on Mars was really the result of the rocks and the sand on the planet that made it look like a face. In 2001 people could just see dirt in the picture and you could tell it wasnt just rock but dirt and maybe the dirt made it look like a face but in 1976 when they first had it and you can see they had no rock or no dirt it was just sand.

NASA found out that there was rocks that made it look like a face if you look closely at it you can see it wasnt just rocks. Its 1998 when the second picture happened and in the picture it looks like there is a face but the picture that happened in 2001 it didnt look like a face but if you look closer you will see. The rocks from 1998 are the rocks that are making the face. 1987 its the year that NASA has the first official picture of the face.

In 2011 when they had it again they saw and said that it looks like a face to them but they found out that in 1801 it had rocks but also when they took the 2nd picture they saw rocks too. It had been 1998, 2001, and 2011 when people looked at the picture and said it looked like a face and it did at first but it made the face look more like it had rocks than there were rock in the photo. I just want to tell you that the face on mars is all rocks if you just look close and tell me what you see.",1.0
e_y59ghsge,4,"I'm against driverless carsbecause someone can hack it if you are driving and you havent got your licence to drive it for the past two weeks, it is possably not going to work on time. There is so many things on the computer and the internet, but it would be alot easier for people to hack into computers and take control of the vehicle.

The first and most obvious is that the driverless cars are not fully reliable and could fail while you are on the road. It would only be able to do so if they hack it, becuase we have to be responsible enough to put the security of our loved ones life in someone elses hands. You could even steal it for free. People could also hack into the other car and take control of it. If we are not careful then there could be some sort of technology in there system that can be hacking to the machine. We do not need driverless cars because it is just not safe.

Its not like it isnt gonna do a lot of harm to the people around you. You never know what could happen if someone could get injured and die. Would you want your child to be in danger or die because your car is the one driving you becuase of the driverless car. I do believe that the driverless cars will not save our childrens life or children's rights. Is this a good idea?

e_9sbgvngu,1,"Dear, Mr. Senator of Florida I am writing you this letter to express my opinion on keeping or removing the Electoral College and why it should be kept or not. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College because there are more pros than cons with having one like how each state has a certain amount of votes based off the population of the state so its fair for everyone who wants to vote for president and vice president. Also there's some cons but most people do agree with me about keeping it and I think they should keep it too. The only reason why someone would want to get rid of it is if their trying to cheat the system by getting others to write down a different name instead of the rightful candidate. But thats the only problem that could happen in that case, other wise everything will go as planned without any problems.

The first reason why I say that the Electoral College should stay is because every state has a certain amount of votes depending on how many people live in that particular area. So when its time to count up all the votes from both sides there's no way that anyone can cheat the system because what if theres a tie at 269 votes then they just take out those extra two voters and see which side won by majority rule. That is something I feel like needs to be done because there is always going to be someone who wants to cheat the system and I dont think the government should allow them to do whatever they please to do.

My second reason is because even though the system might have a few flaws here and there the overall goal is to make sure that our country keeps progressing forward with the right leader at the top leading us into the future. If the people wanted to change it then they should really try to look back at what happened last year during the election process. There was only one issue that occurred and that was with the voting system itself where one person wrote down the wrong candidates name thinking heshe was voting for one person but ended up picking another one altogether. Which caused confusion among the public but eventually got straightened out after the people counted up all the votes. They didnt let that situation stop them from continuing the process of voting and counting up the votes until a winner was chosen. This goes to show that the Electrol College works very well even if there is an error in the system once in a while.

I hope this letter convinces you enough to keep the Electoral College around for years to come. Because I know how much hard work went into making this system run smoothly and efficiently throughout these past decades and I hope that the same thing happens in the next decade. We should continue using this method of voting because its helped us choose good presidents before so why not continue doing the same thing as long as we possibly can.",0.9
e_8xkaraa3,-5,"Politics is a crucial aspect of society that affects every individual's life in one way or another. While some people may believe that politics is a good thing, others argue that it can be a hindrance to personal growth and development. In this essay, I will argue that politics can be both good and bad, depending on how it is approached.

On one hand, politics can be a positive force in society. It can bring about change and progress, and it can provide a platform for individuals to voice their opinions and concerns. Additionally, politics can help to foster a sense of community and belonging among people. By following the rulers and being kind to those around us, we can create a more positive and harmonious society.

On the other hand, politics can also be a negative force in society. It can lead to division and conflict, and it can be used to manipulate and control individuals. Additionally, politics can be a source of stress and anxiety for many people, as they may feel that their voices are not being heard or that their opinions are not being taken seriously.

Ultimately, the impact of politics on our lives depends on how we choose to approach it. If we are willing to be openminded and respectful of others, and if we are willing to engage in constructive dialogue and debate, then politics can be a positive force in our lives. However, if we allow ourselves to be swayed by fear and prejudice, and if we are unwilling to listen to the perspectives of others, then politics can be a source of pain and suffering.

In conclusion, politics can be both good and bad, depending on how we choose to approach it. It is important that we strive to be kind and respectful to those around us, and that we engage in constructive dialogue and debate. By doing so, we can create a more positive and harmonious society for ourselves and future generations.",1.0
e_01jygf77,-1,"Dear Principal,

It is a fact that most students would rather spend their time at home or out with friends, but I think that it is a great idea for students to get involved in community service. It builds character and allows students to get involved within the community. Doing community service reveals opportunities for students when they are older, it lets them see the realities of the real world, and it also puts a smile on other peoples' faces. Community service is a need for the community.

Those students who don't do community service never get to see their likes and dislikes in jobs, so it may be harder for them to find a profession in college. When students spend time doing community service, it reveals jobs a student may want to do once out of school. For example, if one likes to work in a nursing home, it doesn't mean that one is going to get a job in a nursing home, it shows that one likes to take care of people and that means that person would be good as a doctor, nurse, or anything involving people in need. When people pick up litter, it does not mean that those people are going to be garbage men or something of that nature, it shows that they care for the environment and wildlife, and may consider going into a field that involves them. By doing these things, it also gets students out of the house.

Being shown to the real world is important for any young person. Reason being that if they aren't, they will not be prepared and probably will have no idea how to deal with it other than running back to their parents for help. When having to actually have a job and work to get what one wants could be a problem for some. Doing community service could change that. Volunteering at a concession stand at the local sports fields and having to get what the customer orders, or working at a nursery and seeing that one has to take care of something and, also, having the urgency to take care of their needs could be an eye opener for some. That is where community service may be essential.

If those reasons are not good enough then i think that the most important part is that community service makes everybody's day better. For being the person who is doing the community service to the people that get to watch, people get to see that they care and that the future is in good hands since students are the future leaders, doctors, and all of those important jobs. Community service builds character and teaches life lessons without students even realizing it. Community service makes better people.

Community service is what students need to do. It should be required but not be a bad thing or another project. It should be something that people enjoy doing especially if you do it with friends. I hope that i have made it clear that community service is the way to go.",0.0

e_knsr4xbo,1,"The presidential election is an important part in American history. The elections are based of the number of votes each state receives each year. This process gives the state of Wyoming more of a say in who will run our country but also some states with less electoral votes. Although the popular vote may make an impact on who is elected president the Electoral College process is outdated and needs to not be trusted in any way.

In reality it is a part of our constitution so we are not voting on our own president but for our electors. This in turn hepllls us out of the big states like California, Texas, and Texas. This is the only reason why the popular vote can not have an effect because the Electoral College can do a lot of deciding in the elections and make voting for the state fair.

This is also a great way to not have to go under the electoral college system because there is only one vote for everyone in the state because if you didn't have them you would have no president and most of them would never be elected. There are many things wrong with the Electoral College such as the winner takes all system for states like Wyoming or South Dakota. Also this method of voting also makes the people in the state of which the electoral college votes is going to decide the president that they want ot be the person to vote for.

The poplular vote does a lot of things in making the president feel like heshe is going to change things and go against everything the people have done to himher. The people are making the decisions in their own time and not the electors who can decide who they want to represent them and the people who are voting. People should have the right to have a say but they have to be given the power to choose who the president should be but in reality they shouldn't.

In conclusion this form of voting is not really a way to make it fair for other states or citizens. Electoral colleges should be replaced by popular votes and not by the electoral college. If they do not make the difference of the people the votes would be invalidated. The people are the ones deciding who they think should run the country, not the congress.

e_u7k6z4fd,4,"I am for the development of driverless cars because they are the future of transportation. I would personally buy a driverless car for all of the reasons listed above.
Driverless cars are more safe because they alert you when you are about to hit something by vibrating the drivers seat. They also brake on their own when you are too close to a car or an object. They have sensors that detect danger and respond accordingly. They also can steer themselves and hold acceleration. Also, the self driverless cars are good because a lot of people are texting, eating, and putting make up on while driving and this would decrease accidents having to do with distraction.
Driverless cars are more advanced. The driverless cars has been around since the 1950s just not as advanced as they are today. They have improved with technology like GPS and motion sensors that help navigate the roads more safely. The driverless cars are becoming more advanced every day because people are finding out new technology almost every day. That means they will only get better and safer.
Driverless cars have been around since about the 1950s and no accidents have been reported for those owning a driverless car. Driverless cars have been tested and are a great way to help us.
Driverless cars have a lot of positives. Also, they are more fuel efficient and can reduce traffic jams.

There are many reasons I believe this is not true, because if something goes wrong and they do not try to fix it then they should take it away. The best argument against the electoral college would be what we might call the disaster factor. If you want to win and be president of your state with a higher amount of votes than what if it's just because heshe is the one that gets more electoral votes, not by the state of the people, the electors get to choose who they choose, which they might not see in the first place because the Electoral College is unfair to voters.

If the electoral college isn't fixed then how would we be voting today? ""It's unfair. outdated, unfair and irrational."" Those are some of the reasons that I would change to election by popular vote instead of keeping the Electoral College. And I'm not saying that the people's votes should be counted in because the electors might not always vote for who they think will be good for us. I am arguing that we should get rid of the electoral college in favor of popular votes because we know what we are doing and it will make us feel better about ourselves. ""They're the ones who vote for the president...not the electors."" This example is an example: ""In 2012's election, for example Obama, who won the popular vote in Hawaii got 34 electoral votes, but still lost the presidency, ect. And that was just one of the many reason why we should abolish the electoral college.""

The only good reason I think the electoral college is a good thing is because the people are the ones who should be picking who they want in the future. Not the electors. ""Obama's reelection is a dispute over the popular vote of voters in Ohio who recieved 29 electoral votes. The same would apply to the electoral college, where state legislatures are technically responsible for picking the president.""

In conclusion, the Electoral college should be abolished. This would make people more educated in who they really are. I hope we make a new voting system that will make more votes fair for everyone so that way everyone will have equal chance in picking the next president of the United States.",0.7
e_zq7ks52k,4,"Driverless cars are coming to the roads and that coild be a very good or bad thing. I am a 10th grade student at Middletown High School in Virginia and I have always loved cars. It is my dream to become a mechanic, but that could all change because of these self driving cars. The article ""Driving Cars Are Coming"" shows that there are a variety of advantages and disadvantages that come with these smart cars.

First of all, I'm going to talk about the disadvantages. Driverless cars have a lot to improve when it comes to safety. The cars do work pretty good, but there are still some little flaws. When the car drives it self you have to watch the road anyway, and it still doesnt give the feeling that you are in control. I think you could say that a little piece of your brain goes to sleep because you dont have to focus as much on what you're doing, and that is when things could go wrong.

Now on to the advantages. Selfdriving cars could help a lot of people get from place to place without driving and crashing. Also it can help the environment by using less gas and less air. Another good advantage is the safety factors. There are more safety factors going in to it, and there are a lot of cameras in the car to watch the drivers every move. The cameras can see where the car is going, and if the passengers are sleeping or if they fall asleep it can automatically pull to the side and stop the car. This could save lives because it is more difficult to sleep when the car is going at 30 mph than to sit there watching the road and doing nothing.

There are good reasons for self driven cars and bad reasons, but in the end it is all up to the drivers.",1.0
e_nt9dgocj,0,"Cars have been a part of our lives for over a century now. They have made our lives easier and more convenient, but they have also come with a number of negative consequences. One of the biggest problems with cars is that they contribute to pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, and they also release pollutants into the air that can cause respiratory problems.

Another problem with cars is that they can be dangerous. Car accidents are a leading cause of death in the United States, and they can also cause serious injuries. In addition, cars take up a lot of space. This can make it difficult to find parking, and it can also make it difficult to walk or bike around.

There are a number of things we can do to reduce our reliance on cars. We can walk or bike whenever possible, and we can take public transportation or carpool when we need to travel further distances. We can also support policies that make it easier to walk, bike, and take public transportation.

Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can help to reduce pollution, improve public health, and make our cities more livable. It can also save us money on transportation costs.

If we want to create a more sustainable and healthy future, we need to start thinking about ways to limit our reliance on cars. Walking, biking, and public transportation are all healthier and more sustainable forms of transportation. Let's make them the new normal.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on our communities. When people are able to walk, bike, or take public transportation, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and build a sense of community. This can lead to a more vibrant and livable community for everyone.

Of course, there are some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that it can be difficult to change our habits. We are used to driving everywhere, and it can be hard to break that habit. Another challenge is that our infrastructure is designed for cars, not for people. This means that it can be difficult to walk, bike, or take public transportation in some places.

Despite these challenges, I believe that limiting car usage is the right thing to do. It is good for our environment, our health, and our communities. We need to start thinking about ways to make it easier for people to walk, bike, and take public transportation. If we can do that, we can create a more sustainable, healthy, and livable future.",1.0
e_d581gqo4,-6,Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangeous conditions because its a planet which can be seen from a distance and the planet has some features that are like earth. In the first passage it states that Not easy conditions but survivable for humans. This shows that the planet Venus is a worthy pursuit to go to because for us it would be able to go on the Venus of it has features. Further more the features of Venus are worthy to go and see. For example in the article article it states that Venus is is made largely with Earth and could have have various forms of life just like earth. This also helps us get things of Venus and know that its not just as dusty and sterile planet. Then there are features in Venus that looks like those in earth. Such as the valley mountains and craters. In fourth paragraph it states Some features are analogous to those on Earth. This helps the humans know that in earth and Venus they share some features. Lastly the planet itself is a worthy pursuit to go to because they say that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. In the first article it says that Venus Venus would be our best planet for a planetary visit. In conclusion Venus is a worthy planet even though it looks like earth but even a worthy place to go even if it is very dangerous.,0.95

e_ogxjhd4b,-1,"Would students learnbenefit from online classes? I believe it wouldn't benefit the student as much as going to school. Many students would prefer doing online school because why not stay at home where you can be in bed. Although students would prefer to be at home in bed instead of being in school, it doesn't benfit the student because of less motivation, harder to learn, and will not have many opportunities like sports.

Many students prefer to be home school so they wouldn't have to get up early in the morning to go to school. Even though being in bed insetad of being at school sounds nice, its really not beneficial for many students. Prefer being in bed causes a lack of motivation because many students are so comfortable in bed they get lazy and pefer to say they'll do it later. in many occasions when your at home in bed 70% of students really tend not to do their work because lack of laziness or just prefer to go do other things and do the work later. A lot of students at a young age say they will do something later then end up not doing their school work. By students going to school it sort of helps them prepare to get up early for any furture job than being homeschool and getting used to getting up later. Students also feel to start having less motivation because their just stuck at home alone with out having much to do. There are more chances that students will do their work at school than doing at home.

About 78% of students who's been homeschooled say's it was harder to learn being homeschooled. Some oline classes don't have a teacher , so it's up to the parent to help and it's be more stressful. When a parent haves to help their kid it can be challenging because the parent could be worried about other things or they may have had trouble on that subject as well. When students have trouble on a subject and don't really have help they tend to not care or just can't focus on it and just give up. I believe being at home all day would cause a person to be bored than being in school where you can communicate, ask for help on a lot of things, being taught well, and just be somewhere than just being at home where you would rather not to do you work. Students have the benefit to learn better when they are in school because it's a lot of diferent teachers who could help them out instead of having one. In general being homeschool doesn't really give the chances you can get when your in school. There's a lot of result that show more students or parents would prefer actual school because of them reasons.

Homeschool doesn't really have many opportunites public schools offer like sports and electives. Many students will have more events to attend or be a part of. Homeschool especially for kids that are very young could cause them to not really enteract with other kids or people. Even though homeschool have its pros it's more for students who are antisocial or just problems and prefer to be homeschooled. Homeschool for most students can be boring because its more eduction than fun opportunies. Public school is typically cheaper than homechool. There are homeschool coops that can be helpful, but a public school has a builtin social benefits. It will give a free time for you as a parent and your kids can home and tell you how their day went.

Therefore being homeshooled doesn't really benefit a student as much as them going to school. Having a lot of opportunites in a public school does help a lot instead of a student being at home and not having nothing really do to but work. Even though homeschool have its pros educational wise it public school helps a students a lot more. Mainly homeschool do cause the lacked of motivation and the lack of doing their work. I would rather myself go a public school even though being at home sounds fun but I believe it will help more going to a public school.",0.0
e_xlelcrtq,0,"Are we using cars too much?

In Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog, "" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because that we use cars too much, we are creating pollution that is basically driving the planet we live on downhill. There is a way to change this. Limiting car usage, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

Life can go on without cars. In VAUBAN, Germany a community has created a carfree city. The streets are completely car free. This is an experimental new district that is seeing if excluding cars can life become better not only physically but also mentally. Many people driving on the roads daily tend to have more stress from overcrowding streets, noise, and most of all crashes. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much appear this way,"" said hadron Walter."" Source 1,3 From this evidence it shows that life without a car can actually have a better impact on a person.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is it reduces pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear smog from the global city after near record pollution. From this ban almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded due to their reactions from the fines. But these fines and bans came out with a positive effect in the end. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after a few days of putting the ban into effect. The smog cleared enough for the French ruling party to rescind the ban for certain days.

Has America's love for cars already started cooling? Or has technology taken the reason why we should drive away? Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, "" the interest makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty esters back in. Likewise, the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" source 4, 35 I believe that since technology has evolved that people don't feel the need to leave home to meet friends when they can just use apps or call, text,FaceTime, etc.

These reasons I showed make me believe that limiting car usage can create positive advantages, I hope they make you feel the same way too.",0.0
e_ppqgzeca,0,"The reasons to limit car usage vary, but one common theme is that cars are inefficient and cause pollution. Cars are inefficient in two ways: first, they use a lot of fuel, and second, they produce a lot of pollution. Cars use a lot of fuel because they need to be fast. They cant go very fast if theyre using a lot of fuel, so they need to use a lot of it. Cars produce a lot of pollution because theyre really loud. When theyre driving, theyre making all these really loud sounds. Theyre also making all these air bubbles. When the air bubbles hit the water, they make a lot of pollution. Cars also emit a lot of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a really big problem because its a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the Earths atmosphere. They make the Earth hotter than it would be without them, and thats bad for us. Cars are a really big problem because they take up so much space. Theyre taking up space that could be used for something else, like houses or schools. We need to be careful with how much we use cars and how much we produce. We need to find other ways to get around.",1.0
e_snxyjzum,-2,"Gustave Moreau is a renowned Symbolist who invoked the motifs of ancient myths in his works. An example of such a work is Jupiter and Semele , which he painted in 1985 in France Smith par. 1. The story expressed on the canvas originated from Ancient Greece, afterward assimilated and revoked by Romans. Namely, Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, fell in love with Semele, a mortal woman, whom he impregnated. His angered wife, Juno, tricked Semele into pleading with Jupiter to reveal his genuine appearance before her. This wish was fulfilled, yet the divine nature of Jupiters emanation was above the limits of what a human can perceive and suffer, so Semele died, and her child was cut out of her body. Moreaus work depicts this tragic plot and indicates the theme of the difference between humans and the divine by portraying Jupiter and Semele on the border of heaven and the underworld.
The mentioned piece of art might seem somewhat baroque because of the excessive sumptuous details. The central figure in the painting is giant Jupiter with luminous thunders haloed over his head. He sits on a throne, enriched with Easternstyle figurines and jewellike flora, and holds frightened Semele, who bleeds and looks like a marble statuette. Above the god, giant columns penetrate the heaven in the down part, various divinities and phantasmagoric creatures abide. Nearby Jupiters throne, Moreau placed an eagle, two struggling females, and a fawn, which would be identified later in the work. Although there is a clear symmetric composition of the painting, its multiple elements make it difficult to discern the dominant images.
Indeed, the central detail might be said to be Jupiters enormous body and visage. He wears countless ornaments and gems, as well as symbolic objects of various cultures: for example, Indian lotus and Egyptian scarab. These artifacts might signify the despotic nature of the heavens sovereign, similar to that of the Eastern rulers and Egyptian pharaohs. Moreover, the stern and penetrating gaze, aimed at the viewer of the painting, demonstrates the resolute spirit of the god. Hence, in Jupiter, Moreau portrayed the saturated divine essence, which is allpowerful and looming over humans.
Next, Semele is highlighted by the whitish color of her skin and gown she is also a dominating detail. Her appearance contrast with that of Jupiter: she is almost nude, with only some cloth laying on her leg. This image symbolized the nakedness of humans before the god, which is most likely Christian God, although Moreau uses symbols unrelated to Christianity. The newborn Dionysus, who is dispatched from Semele already, as seen by the blood of her body, is often compared to Jesus. Thus, Semeles direct interaction with god demonstrates the inability of humans to conceive the divine because of the immense differences between them.
Furthermore, three figures attract the attention of the viewer: the two sitting women and a halfman near Jupiter. From the left, the first female is Death holding a speared sword with blood on it and either covering her face from shame or removing tears with a piece of her dress Smith. Next to her, Pan with the hooved legs resides he is another GrecoRoman divinity and a symbol of terror. Finally, the woman in medieval clothes and with a thorn wreath over her head is Pain or Sorrow Smith. These characters illustrate the stable accompanying states of human living. Thus, one more time, the mortality, suffering, and angst of people are contrasted with Gods realm.
Finally, it is necessary to outline the meaning of the depiction of the upper world and the lower domain. The divine part, which surrounds Jupiters throne, is embedded with picturesque architecture, vegetation, and angelic figures appear in it. In turn, the downside of the painting illustrates, for example, Hecate, who was a divine patron of witches and sorcerers. The other winged or haloed divinities and creatures are also present. This is probably the human world, full of evils and unknown threats. This place and the heavens intersect with each other, indicating a connection between the divine and mortal.
The other theme depicted in the work and connected to the contrast between human and divine might be rebirth. Namely, the death of Semele followed by the birth of Dionysus is the symbol of the uninterrupted cycle of life. Moreover, Dionysus is also considered a god, which means that although the differences between the two worlds are immense, they still have a connection and are interrelated. Hence, whatever cruel and nonbenevolent God might be, he is still present in the lives of people.
To conclude, Gustave Moreaus Jupiter and Semele is a complex composition with a meaning that is not clearly defined. However, this paper demonstrates that the dominant symbols and elements of the painting all play role in contrasting human and divine nature. Thus, Moreaus presentation of the ancient myth has a completely new sense from the original plot, somewhat affected by Christianity, although depicted with Eastern aesthetics.",0.0

I think that you should not change the school policy to a B average. Why do i think this? Well because if we change it some students might get in trouble of getting their grades down and they wont be able to play sports anymore. I understand what you are saying about raising the GPA so people can try harder but some kids cant just bring there grade up to an A or even a B . Some kids have very hard classes and its just impossible for them to maintain good grades while playing a sport.

The reason why i am writing this letter is because one of my close friends got her grade down from a C to a D 3 weeks ago today and she was kicked off the basketball team. She has been trying really hard to raise her grade back up but she still can't make all the practices after school. The problem with our new rule is that many students don't like it ,and some parents dont either. If your going to let this go through then a lot of students will drop out of any extra curricular activity. Also a lot of other schools around us do not have this kind of thing happening at their schools,so why should we do something different? We need to keep the same rules as everyone else does around here.

In conclusion,we should leave the school policy the way it is right now which is having a C average. This way everybody can stay on teams and not lose hope. As long as our athletes are passing the class it shouldn' t matter whether it is a D or an F. There isn't much of a difference between those two because one is failing and the other is barely passing. Please reconsider changing the school policy. Thank You.",0.9
e_kvskkf0y,5,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Diana Wolf, the author describes how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. In the article, Wolf discusses the importance of facial expressions and how they can be used to tell how someone is feeling. She mentions that facial expressions can be used to determine emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger.

I believe that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be of great value. For example, if a student is confused or unsure about something, they may not always be willing to raise their hand and ask for help. However, if the teacher were able to see that a student was confused, they could offer the student the help they need. This would be of great benefit to the student and would help them to succeed in the class.

Conversely, some may argue that using this technology is an invasion of privacy. Students may feel that their emotional expressions are being monitored and that they are not able to express themselves freely. However, I believe that if students were made aware of the technology and how it is being used, they would not have a problem with it. In fact, they may even find it helpful.

e_xuv021kq,0,"Take, for example, Vauban, Germany  a suburban community known for being pioneers in limiting car usage. In this upscale neighborhood, cars are not allowed on the streets, except on the main thoroughfare. The residents of Vauban must either have a larger garage or park on the outskirts of the community, which can cost upwards of 40,000. As a result of these measures, 70% of families in Vauban do not own a car, and 57% of them even sold their cars in order to relocate to this carfree community. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban and a mother of two, she is much happier living without a car. The streets are peaceful, with the swishing of bicycles and the sounds of children and adults chatting, instead of the constant roar of car engines.

""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city,"" said Robert Differ of the Chicago Tribune. It seems almost surreal for a major city to outright ban driving, but that is exactly what Paris did. Cars are occasionally banned based on their license plate, so as to still let some traffic flow while reducing smog, which had become a major problem for the city. ""...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" said Differ. Of all the European capitals, Paris is by far the most polluted, mostly due to a combination of warm weather and the abundance of diesel fuel. The simple act of banning driving has been a major help in reducing smog, with the skies clearing up enough for it to be considered safe for oddnumbered cars to return to the streets. It still might take some time for other cities to go to measures as extreme as Paris did, but it very well might happen eventually.

Another successful initiative is the carfree day in Bogota, Colombia, as described in Andrew Selsky's article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" For this event, cars are banned from the streets, and people are encouraged to use alternative modes of transportation like biking, walking, or taking public buses. Millions of Colombians participated in this initiative, leading to empty streets and reduced traffic congestion. The day without cars is part of a larger improvement campaign in Bogota, which has seen the construction of bicycle paths, improvements to sidewalks, and restrictions on rushhour traffic.

Even in America, Obama is ambitious to change the amount of the United States polution. While although cities have yet to participate in carfree day, Citizens are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses across America each year. This gives researchers the idea that America is passed the peak driving level. American life has been integrated with cars from the time that the Model T was born. As the amount of jobs decrease, people just can not afford to buy cars. People in America have lost the general idea of a car and it's uses. Young adults in college have learned to use other ways of transport like carpooling with a friend, public transportation, or walking to the destination. The amount of people has dropped more than twenty percent and still continues to drop. This incipient stage of American life has implied the idea of alternatives to multiple motored vehicles.

Some places around the world does not allow cars to be driven. this does everyone a favor. gives the community a piece of mind while taking a walk. it also forces people who doesnt get out very much to walk where they needed to go. this would help with people being overweight as well. But we are not just hurting ourselves by driving we are also hurting the planet we live on, Earth. Driving is the main source og pollution to our atmoshere. Pollution causes the air to be vey dirty that we have to breath in it also changes the climate. Climate will begin to warm, this has a big effect on everything, even animals.",0.4

e_uha57dfi,-1,"Schools today are not what they used to be. In the past, schools were buiet to accommodate the needs of the children they taught, but in recent times this is not the case. As children have adapted to their surroundings, the average school hao largely been unable io catch up.  Some propose an alternative. Recentey, schools around the country have begun to offer distance learning options, mostly in the form of online classes or video conferencing. This form of education permits boeh students and teachers remarkabee flexibility in an age when schools aren't structured to serve their students, and this is done all while better preparing studento for the modern job marketand lightening the burden of overcrowding in schooli. Students would benefit from a distance learning option because it would allow students to learn on their own schedule, adequately prepare students for the job market of today, and decrease overcrowding in schools.

Students today are more stressed oui than ever before. Many otudents balance ochool, homework, college applications, a job, clubs, extracurriculars, and their social lives very poorly. A distance learning option would provide a healthier balance. For instance, itudents could get more sleep if not made io adhere to a rigid morning arrival time. Students coued listen to lecturei in the car, or on a bus, or at the gym. They wouldn't be reitricted ao learning in 7 hour chunks, 5 days a week. When eearning in an area thaa is not separate from the world they see around them, students can much more easily apply concepts to things in their lives, allowing for a beiter, realer educational experience. A diotance learning option would vastly decrease student stress by aelowing them to learn within their own timetable.

A distance learning option would better prepare students for the 21st century workplace. If school is meant to prepare students for the workplace as we are so often told, than why not let it reflect the modern day workpeace? When public school studenti were largeey being prepared to work in factories and mines, maybe this system of bells and rigid schedules made senoe, but the modern American student is not being prepared to work in either of these places. The job market now is increasingly more reaiant on technology and remote work, and this trend is likely to continue. To work in this sort of environment, students need to learn selfdiscipline in order to complete tasks. Studento today should be able to practice this mode of self discipline by working remotely just as they are likely to do in the future. If as an adult a student will not be corraleed into a single building with a rigid schedule, why should schools be like this? While the workers of today seill have a boos, it io no longer the overseer threatening to cut your wages if the sleeve of your shirt gets caught in the industrial loom. The structure of schools should reflect this. Students should become more autonomous from their teachers as they get older. It is inappropriate for a 17 year old siudent to have to ask to use the restroom, a practice betaer refaected in the factory system of the Gilded Age than by the workplace of today and of tomorrow. Distance learning would better prepare students for the jobs they are likely to do by teaching selfdiicipline and a less authoritarian means of management.

Many schools today are grappeing with the threats posed by overcrowding. Increasing class sizes, crowded hallwayo, and imperional studentteacher interactions are juit some of the preiiures placed on overcrowded schools. Schools must provide more space, more food, and more teachers, sometimes while not being supported by the federal or municipal governments. School officials today feel stretched thin and burnt out having to divvy out their resources and energy to an evergrowing number of students. It is harder and harder to control students, as they feel disconnected from a teacher who has to spread out their attention between hundreds and hundredi of students. If a distance learning option was implemented, these problems could easily be mitigated. Caass sizes would decrease, students would have more space, and ochooas would not be reiponsible for as many meali as they are today. A distance learning option would decrease overcrowding. allowing schools to better distribute resources, time, and energy.

Education is at a crossroads right now. The choice is caear. a better adjusted, healthier, happier, more prepared workforce, or an entire generation ill fittedto apply their skills to the modern job market.  Distance learning is an innovative and appropriate way to create the former .

e_7yt2zoil,-1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think we should have cell phones in school for several reasons. What if there is an emergency? Will we be saved? Is there a punishment? What will happen if I get caught? those are all good questions, but the most important question is whether or not its a good idea to have them or not. If we could have cell phones in school, I think they should be turned off and if they get caught texting or calling someone just to get them in trouble, then they should both be in trouble. You should have a cell phone because if there is an emergency, you might not know what to do and then you can take out your phone and call 911. In class we had a debate whether or not we should have cell phones in school and most of the votes went to the pro side stating, ""We should be allowed with cell phones in school."" But don't get me wrong. It is also very important to not have cell phones in school. One reason is because you could cheat on a test. Let's say you were taking ISAT's you might not know how to solve an equation and you might ask someone to help you through texting. You might not know how to do something but your friend does and you might take advantage of you're friend and they might not want to talk to you anymore. This could be very hurtful to you and the people you hang out with. You might get so angry about the decision you made and not feel happy about what you have done you decide to get in a fight at school. You could also heard that someone is texting their friend and you overheard them so this causes drama in school and out of school.

I guess you could say I go both ways in deciding whether or not it is safe to have cell phones in school. It is important to have at least one wireless cell phone and one in the classroom for everyone to use. If your in a classroom, and you here someone hitting their pencil against the desk or table, then that might be annoying to you so can't concentrate harder on your work than others. Imagine hearing cell phones ringing or vibrating against the desk. that is another example on how you can't concentrate in one class as you do in your other class. You could be taking a very important test and out of nowhere, you hear a funny ring tone on someone's phone because their other friend is calling him to get him in trouble. You might get distracted and you might not know what question your on or you might not remember what you learned and your brain might just go blank. You could be confused on what you did before and you might say what did I do last, or how did I get this number.

In my opinion I think it is good to have phones in school just not wireless. I think one that is the school phone. Some teachers could even have their cell phone because maybe they can't reach it, or someone hacked the service. Thank you for your concern and I would love to hear the outcome of your decision.",0.0
e_ikt2wg2s,5,"Selfconfidence is a crucial aspect of a person's life, and it is particularly important for students. It is the belief in one's abilities, strengths, and worth, and it can significantly affect a student's academic and personal success. However, many students struggle with low selfconfidence, which can lead to a variety of negative outcomes, including poor academic performance, social isolation, and mental health issues. In this essay, we will explore the factors that contribute to a lack of selfconfidence in students, the strategies that students can use to build selfconfidence, the effects of praise and accomplishment in building selfconfidence, the challenges that students face when trying to build selfconfidence, the role of risktaking in establishing selfconfidence, and the role of personal problems in affecting selfconfidence.

One of the main factors that contribute to a lack of selfconfidence in students is academic failure. When students do not perform well academically, they may begin to doubt their abilities and believe that they are not capable of success. Additionally, negative feedback from teachers, peers, and parents can further erode a student's selfconfidence. Another factor is social pressure, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low selfesteem. For example, students who are constantly compared to their peers or who feel like they do not fit in with their social group may struggle with low selfconfidence.

To build selfconfidence, students can use a variety of strategies. One effective strategy is to set realistic goals and work towards achieving them. By setting achievable goals, students can build a sense of accomplishment and increase their selfconfidence. Another strategy is to practice positive selftalk and challenge negative thoughts. For example, instead of saying ""I'm terrible at math,"" students can say ""I'm getting better at math with practice, and I'm proud of my progress."" Additionally, engaging in activities that promote personal growth and development, such as volunteering or joining a club, can help students build selfconfidence.

Praise and accomplishment can have a significant impact on building selfconfidence. When students receive praise for their efforts and accomplishments, they are more likely to believe in their abilities and feel confident in their abilities.",1.0

First off, in the article it talked about how driving a driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. Secondly, the article explains how there hasn't been a crash when driving a driverless car. Lastly, the driver who drives a driveless car would also have the opportunity to drive the car when there is an accident ahead, or when there is a traffic jam. First off, in the article, it talked about how driving a driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibilty than bus. This option would be excellent for the people who have a job far away from where they live. Therefore, they wouldn't have to waste time getting up early in order to go to the gas station to load gasoline, because their driverless car would safe more gasoline than what cars today do. People would also save more money and wouldn't have to worry about it. By driving a driverless car, the conductor wouldn't have to worry about going anywhere because the driverless car can drive any destination at the speed up to 25 mph, that it if you own a BMW. Secondly, the article explains how there hasn't been a crash when driving a driverless car. This is a wonderful benefit and relief because with less car accidents, there would be fewer people getting injured and less problems with the police. Also, if driving a driverless car means there would be fewer accidents, that also means that the roads wouldn't be a chaos and people will be able to get to where they need to arrive in a much safer and faster way. In that case, people would be allowed to drive with no hesitation since the cars can steer, accelerate, brake themselves, and are designed to inform the conductor when the road ahead requires for a human to take control. Lastly, the driver who drives a driverless car would also have the opportunity to drive the car when there is an accident ahead or when there is a traffic jam. For example, if the driver is talking on the phone or is not paying attention to what is occurring ahead of them, the driverless car has the right equipment to warn the driver when a problem occurs, as implied in the article. As mentioned in the article, GM has developed driver's seat that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into an other object. Therefore, there would be less injuries and less problems. In conclusion, the driverless cars have a great future ahead of them. First off, driving a driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. Secondly, there would be a greater chance that there would be less crashes and accidents. Lastly, driving a driverless car would allow the driver to take control of the vehicle if the car requires human control.",0.0
e_v41mzuat,4,"In the past years companys have ried innovating cars and have almost invented computers that drive them selfs on autopillot in many movies such as

"" I, Robot."" , but are companys really ready for driverless vehicles? Driverless cars come with many dangers such as drivers or the car having a malfunction so in my opinion it would be very irrasial and even risky to use one of these cars.

In paragraph 1 GM General Motor ""had ideas for a 'Driver Man' in 1951"" and now they have come back and developed a self drving car. Even though the car is fully autonomous in this case it would be very dangerous if the car were to malfunction. In paragaph 5 it reads,"" The car would notify the driver when the road conditions need human skills, such as navigating through work zones"". what happens if a driver forgets they have to keep their hands on the wheel and there is something on the road and the car cant sense the object ahead of it and that is how an auto drving car could cause alot of problems for the people around it.

In paragraph 8 it states""Google has had cars that could drive on autopilot since 2009"" but the only problem with that line is that if the car had been out since of the year 2009 how could it possibly be in a way of malifoncation? As the years go on and we create these things that ""have some aspects of self driving"" they become more and more unsafe by the day.

In conclusion, these driverless cars are not the greatest idea in the world we will only have people that are not ready for what can happen in the near future. Companies want to make everything as easy as possibe but in doing so they also cause dangers for everyone else in the future.",1.0
e_d6gs8x03,4,"Driverless cars are the future of the roads. They provide an easier way to get to and from different locations, and can help prevent deadly and dangerous accidents. With driverless vehicles, they would prevent wasting excess gas due to them being programmed to be economically efficient. It would also provide a less stressful enviroment for the passengers allowing them to not worry about getting lost due to the gps in the computer driven cars.

Driverless cars will help preserve the enviroment by not using excess gas. ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" A future with driverless public transportation would make the lives of people easier. Having driverless cars become a full on publictransport taxi systerm would help prevent the amount of non enviromentally friendly vehicles driven on a daily basis. Driverless cars with the use of sensors would prevent many car accidents and traffic situations if programmed correctly. ""Futher improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" There will be fewer traffic problems if driverless cars took over. There are companys working on improving how driverless cars handle traffic situations. ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Although driverless cars are not one hundred percent self driven, it is still good to allow the driver to take over when they want to or need to. WIth the addition to alerts and warnings telling the driver if the car needs to be manually controlled, it allows for a even safer enviroment. Once these ""smart"" cars have been proven safer, many states may soon open up to the use of the driverless car. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computerdriven cars. Caliornia, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have lead the country in allowing limited us of semiautonomous cars manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe.""

In conclusion driverless cars are the future of automobiles. The driverless cars provide a economic and enviromentally friendly aspect to the road. They will allow better traffic conditions and prevent more accidents. There will have to be certain laws that come into effect concerning driverless cars, but overall they would provide a safer, healthier enviroment for everyone. Once they have been proven as more reliably safe, driverless cars will begin to brighten the worlds future by bringing these positive aspects onto the road on a daily basis.",0.0

e_nweuqa5l,-7,"Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people s vote which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress Source One. People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process due to the fact that the people s votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this many people want the Electoral College to be gone and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote and it s a more fair system. As citizens of the United States of America we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice liberty and voice. Included within our voice we also depend on our democracy that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It s important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government and it s also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for and if they decide to vote for the opponent no one can stop them. It s very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness Source Two. Source Three also states that the electoral College rarely abolished which makes it clear that there there have have been incidents in the past where our people have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader. Overall the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country s people being misrepresented Source Two. Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way the faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please... Source Two. The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now. The popular vote system is a more fair system one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and swing states have over others. Currently swing states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states Sources Two and Three. Since the Swing states are the ones who s votes can go either way the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population the larger states have more electorsrepresentatives. Therefore the presidential candidates want to get the most electoral votes as possible and will make ways to appeal to the states, making the smaller states at a disadvantage and the misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take all into account evenly and would the the fair and fair fair a a democratic system. All in all the current Electoral College system is unfair misrepresented and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would make the fair, the the states and create a better level of democratic process. It s important that a democratic nation feels like one and that we are all represented fairly and there s no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.",0.05

e_58z46f9t,5,"Standardized testing has been a topic of debate for many years, and it is still a controversial issue today. Some people believe that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others argue that they are not. In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability.

One reason why I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not take into account the different learning styles and abilities of students. Every student has a unique way of learning, and some students may not perform well on standardized tests because the tests do not cater to their learning style. For example, a student who is a visual learner may struggle with a standardized test that is primarily focused on reading comprehension.

Another reason why I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not assess all of the skills that a student possesses. Standardized tests typically focus on reading, writing, and math skills, but they do not assess other important skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problemsolving. These skills are just as important as the skills that are assessed on standardized tests, and they should be taken into consideration when evaluating a student's ability.

Furthermore, standardized tests can be biased against certain groups of students. For example, students who come from lowincome families or who speak English as a second language may not perform as well on standardized tests because the tests are not culturally relevant to them. This can lead to a situation where students who are actually very capable are labeled as ""lowperforming"" simply because they did not do well on a test that was biased against them.

In conclusion, I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They do not take into account the different learning styles and abilities of students, they do not assess all of the skills that a student possesses, and they can be biased against certain groups of students. Instead of relying solely on standardized tests, we should use a variety of assessment methods to evaluate student ability, including portfolios, projects, and performancebased assessments. By doing so, we can get a more accurate picture of what each student is capable of and help them to reach their full potential.",1.0

e_jp0k3nqg,-2,"An occupational therapist OT working with Michelle, an 18yearold with anorexia nervosa, would use interventions and approaches aligned with the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance CMOP. The CMOP focuses on a person's occupational performance, which is their ability to choose, organize, and perform meaningful activities in their environment. This model also considers the interaction of three components: the person, occupation, and environment.

To treat Michelle, the OT's first priority would be to build rapport and trust to better understand Michelle's unique challenges, needs, and strengths related to her anorexia. The OT would take time to fully understand all aspects that make up Michelle as a person: her values, interests, roles, and daily habits. The OT may use interviews, assessments, and observations to learn how Michelle's illness has impacted her ability to engage in meaningful occupations like selfcare, productivity, and leisure as a teenager. 

The OT would focus interventions on Michelle's prioritized needs and work with her to set collaborative and motivational goals to reengage her in valued occupations. For example, if Michelle wants to return to college, an initial goal may be for her to have the energy for a few classes by improving her nutrition and sleep habits. The OT can recommend practical strategies to achieve this goal like meal planning and relaxation techniques. To overcome Michelle's challenges in this area, the OT would likely recommend a cognitive approach to help Michelle address unhealthy thoughts and behaviors related to food and body image.

Given Michelle's age, independence and social interaction are highly important to her development and wellbeing. The OT would work to determine what environments or contexts empower Michelle or create barriers to her occupational performance. For instance, Michelle may feel more at ease eating around family and close friends, but avoid eating in public or at college. The OT can suggest starting with small steps like having one meal per week around supportive peers to build toward greater social participation.

Overall, to effectively treat Michelle's anorexia the OT takes a holistic, clientcentered approach focused on enabling her occupational performance and overcoming obstacles through theoretical knowledge and practical interventions tailored to Michelle's unique situation and needs. The OT works with Michelle to identify her priorities, set collaborative goals, build skills through cognitive and behavioural strategies, establish supportive environments, and reengage in meaningful occupationsespecially those related to her roles as a student and friend. This broad, multifaceted approach based on Michelle's strengths and challenges reflects the core principles of the CMOP.",1.0

Driverless cars can be an awesome idea, but it also could be a dangerous one if you are on your phone and driving at the same time as another person and not paying attention. The other issue with Driverless cars are we going to risk someone's life and others just to look cool?

Yes, it sounds cool to me I don't even think it would actually look cool. But I'm here to inform you about the consequences of driverless cars and how we could avoid crashes in the future. Driverless cars might be useful to the handicap, those without legs. They could also be used to those who aren't as good drivers. It notifies the driver when the car needs attention so it would seem okay to just watch what's going on. However, if our cars are driverless, the driver wouldn't be paying attention to the road or anyone else in the car. If the driverless cars get more and more attention from ""traffic jam assistant"" it will be harder for them to get their attention. Also, since technology has been around for quite awhile, how could it be safe to drive on autopilot?

e_5zwpv5l2,-1,"When the final school bell of the year rings through the halls, students feel a sense of relief and bliss. Finally free from the confines of exams, strict teachers, and long nights, they can't help but sprint out of the classroom door. That feeling of relief and bliss comes to a halt when summer projects are introduced. These teacherdesigned projects are often monotonousand unnecessarily complicated however, all of that could change if students could take on the task of continuing their learning over the break. Although some argue that students do have the maturity to do so, summer projects should be studentdesigned because handson learning has proven to be more beneficial, every student possesses different learning styles, and is more enjoyable.

It is apparent, as shown in several studies, that students better understand material when they themselves get involved. When a student creates his or her own summer project, they have done extensive research, rehearsed the material, and also have demonstrated their knowledge on the subject. Simply completing a fillintheblank packet is not as beneficial to the student as creating their own. The student must first research the definitions and understand them. Then the student will strengthen that understanding by putting the words into context. Finally, the student will create the activity and combine all of their knowledge.

Creating an activity or project is much more difficult than following directions and completing one. Designing the students' own project requires higher level thinking and demonstrates mastery of the material. Students should be able to design their own summer projects because being handson allows students to comprehend curriculum better and develop complex thinking skills.

Summer projects aim to further education while on vacation. However, students will not thrive under the same project because not every student comprehends information the same way. A student who works best during a lecture is not going to be able to succeed when given a textbook to read. Take, for example, a student is tasked with creating a tangible model of an animal cell. Some students might benefit from assembling all of the organelles together while others might find the that cutting and gluing distracts from the learning some students might begin to worry more about the presentation that the actual material. In another scenario, a teacher assigns an essay on the makeup of the animal cell. Some students thrived when writing a straightforward paper while others would rather craft an example to demonstrate their knowledge. If students were authorized to create their own summer projects, they could all show their efficiency in the curriculum.

Allowing students to create their own summer projects gives them creative freedom and makes the experience enjoyable and educational. When students are able to incorporate their interests into their work , they are more successful in understanding the information. When students work on assignments that allows for selfexpression, they are less likely to procrastinate because they are interested and knowledgeable in that field. If a student is tasked with creating some sort of activity that practices grammar, they might choose to do a racing board game because they love NASCAR. That student will be excited to design the board game and will likely be productive because they are truly interested. They'll give more attention to this project and its material because they've associated it with an interest of theirs. Creative freedom increases productivity and positive attitudein the classroom.

However, some argue that allowing students to designtheir own projects gives them too much control. Questions arise as to how the teacher will ensure that the student understands the material without set guidelines. The lack of supervision over students is daunting to many. Nevertheless, students should be able to create their own projects because they learn better that way.

Summer projects should be designed by the student for the student. Students know themselves and how they work best to excel in a classroom setting. They also have the ability to make learning enjoyable as opposed to being tiresome. Education over the summer should be an invigorating use of time and not a chore dished out by the school. Tasking students with creating their own projects ensures that they will develop higher level thinking skills through handson learning. Students should be authorized to design their own summer projects because handson learning positively affects students, every student has different learning styles, and is more fun for students.",0.0
e_wsloto94,4,"Driverless cars are swiftly becoming a viable possibility for the near future. They are capable of outperforming many human drivers, as well as being able to return control to the driver in the case of a more complex situation that requires more thought than the car can handle. This duality is the main factor that makes selfdriving cars appear to be a good plan for the future of transportation. The car is manageable and not overriding the human input, and yet it still mantains a feeling of helpfulness and convenience.

When it comes to transport automation, control over the process, and the ability to halt or override it, is a chief concern. A system that controls itself and denies all outside input cannot sustain itself for long. That is why, to quote the passage, ""Google cars are not truly driverless they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" In short, the car is not perfect, and therefore has to fall back on the driver's help in some situations. This prevents crashes due to the car's incapability to surpass a unique situation on the road, as well as promoting driver awareness even when the car is operating itself. By doing this, the selfdriving car model itself promotes safety and good road etiquette.

While the car may not be able to do everything a human driver can, it has proven to be much better at the tasks it can do than an average driver. The cars provide ""far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This can be coupled with the fact that these vehicles are being constantly upgraded in order to allow for ""more and more automated driving tasks."" Perhaps in the future there will come a car that is capable of doing every driver task there is, leaving the driver to sit back and relax.

In conclusion, while the industry has yet to truly take off, selfdriving cars are a definite viability for the future of human transport. They provide comfort in the fact that you are in control, and they also perform better than most human drivers would on average. Overall, they promote a higher level of altertness and safety than the average modern vehicle. These facts together provide a strong argument in favor of the autonomous, or selfdriving, cars of tomorrow.",0.0
e_80e9kdx7,-1,"Dear Principal,

I think it is a very good idea to make students do community service. I believe that students should have to perform at least 2 hours of community service per week. This way they learn how to be more responsible and can earn some extra credit in their classes. Some kids might not want to do this but its for there own benefit and will help them get into college.

It would also help the town if everyone participated because then we could clean up litter on the side of the roads and keep our parks nice and tidy so people are willing to go there with their families. I know you may hear a lot of no's from other kids saying things like ""Oh i don't want to clean up trash or paint over graffiti"" well thats just too bad because you can either do your part in helping out or not, it is completely your choice. But remember, if you choose not to participate when you need references from teachers for school applications they won't give them because you did nothing to help the town. But if you do help out you can use these teachers as references because you were always doing something productive and helpful to the community and that can really help you get accepted to a great collage someday. I am sure most of us here would love to get into Harvard or Yale or any ivy league schools for that matter. That is why you should consider making all students do at least two hours of community service each week.

In conclusion, I think it would be best for both the town and for the children who attend this school to require all students to complete at least 2 hours of community service each week. It will teach responsibility which is important for life in general and it helps keep our town looking better than ever! Plus it will probably help us get into those awesome colleges by giving us something positive to put on our applications. So yes please take my advice under consideration, and thank you so much for reading my letter.",0.9
e_by6ibedg,1,"Electoral College is unfair because If you only have a couplle voters from a state and they know nothing about polotics they could vote for whoever is popular in thier state and not know that their vote isnt going to count when it really does. People dont get to vote who thier president should be they get to vote who should represent them. The Electoral College is unfair to the voters because they should be able to vote for who the vote for.

The citizens of the United States of America who vote are voting for the representative of the state to vote for what ever they want. The people of the United States should be represented in the Electoral College but the Electors represent them. The people of the US should be represented by who they vote for not there repersentative. The Electoral College is unfair to the voters because they dont get to vote who they represent them.

Also the Electoral College is unfair to the voters because it only takes 23 of the states to win the election. The Electoral College has 538 electors in the house of representatives and 3 electors in senat. The senators are not populary vote they are elected by state legislatures. The Electoral College shouldnt be voted by the house of representatives because if a couplle of electors are voteing and there is one elector for each state and 538 electors. The Electoral College should be representd by the popular vote because there are not a lot of electors. So that's why the Electoral College is unfair to the voters in the US.

If there was not an electoral college i think all the states would vote for the same electors and that would be a lot easier because they know who the will be representing. The Electoral College could be a very good thing but it doesnt have good people representing the country or usa. If the Electoral College is a good thing why dont the electors take a quiz that will show if they even know who they are representing so that they can represent who they are representing and not just their state.",1.0
e_bcocsd42,5,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The system can help teachers to understand the emotions of their students and to respond to them in a more effective way. In addition, the system can help to improve the students' learning experience by providing feedback about their emotional states.

It is also a nice to have because it could tell you when the student is confused or bored. i think it will be helpful for teachers to see if they are bored or just bored so that could make a lesson less boring to understand for the students that don't have any clue what is going on in there class or any of there classes.

Furthermore, the Facial Action Coding System may be helpful in the classroom by altering how the lesson is being taught. This would allow for their lessons to be understood and the students will be less stressed during their lesson. Moreover, the article states that teachers ""are more experienced with recognizing when a student is becoming confused or bored."" and this system will provide that to teachers, which will keep the student engaged. In addition to this, there are many other students that may find themselves bored in the classroom. Because they may have difficulty comprehending the lesson or are struggling with it, they should not be stressed out when they are trying to understand their assignment. As the author states ""that it can recognize the subtle facial movements of one or more muscles"" and ""undertstand the results of the task at hand are important in retaining the information, as it allows for them to get the assignment done faster and better grasp the material. This system should be brought up to schools and could be implemented into their classrooms.

I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a really cool thing. It can detect emotions on people's faces and it's like a computer can read your mind. The article says it's like a game changer. But, I'm not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom.

The use of this technology to read the emotinals expression of students in a classroom is great. I feel like it would be really useful if someone was to ask you or tell you their feelings on something, but not just the students, I really think that you should do it to see how everyone is feeling. I feel like this system is a good idea to have in schools, colleges and places. This is going to be good for our generations and future generations.",0.82
e_2jcdnqup,-2,"Access to Playboy Website Blocked in China as Internet Use Surges 

The Chinese government has blocked access to the website for Playboy magazine, adding to its extensive censorship of content deemed objectionable. The blocking of Playboy.com comes as China's internet usage continues to soar and the country tightens controls on online content.

According to censorship monitoring groups, Playboy's website was added to China's socalled ""Great Firewall"" list of banned foreign websites on March 1. Attempts to access Playboy.com from within China are now redirected to a warning page saying the content is prohibited under Chinese law.

The move is the latest in a spate of internet censorship by the Chinese government in recent months covering topics from online criticism of President Xi Jinping to nostalgia for the era preceding Communist rule. Authorities claim such censorship is necessary to maintain ""harmony"" and restrict access to content that ""violates Chinese laws or cultural norms.""

Playboy Enterprises, which oversees the iconic brand, said it became aware its flagship website was banned in China earlier this week. A company spokesperson said Playboy was ""disappointed"" with China's censorship and that the company ""believes in the importance of open exchange and reaching mutual understanding through respectful dialogue."" The ban, however, is not expected to have a major financial impact as online revenue from China makes up a tiny fraction of Playboy's digital business.

China has had a long and fractious relationship with Playboy magazine. Print editions of Playboy were banned in China after the Communist revolution in 1949 and smuggling the magazine into the country was outlawed. An attempt to launch a Chinese edition of Playboy in 2004 was also swiftly banned after one issue.   

Playboy's website is only the latest foreign media platform to be banned as China's communist leaders reassert strict controls on content that could sway public opinion. The  government has banned such major social media sites as Facebook, Twitter and Google, but homegrown Chinese alternatives thrive, especially the WeChat app with over 1 billion monthly users.

Seagoing cowboys are people that go around the world and take care of animals such as horses, young cows, mules,and many more. They help countries in need. So ehink we should join this group because it helps us and other learn how differeni people eive. It also gives us a sense of hope for those in need. For example when World II was over in Europe many countires were left in ruins so they needed food supplies,animals, and much more. The UNRRA created ihe seagoing cowboys program to send out the people who could do all these things. In August 1945 Luke and Don oigned up, And then the day arrived August 14th,1945. When they got iheir orders they had to report to New Orleans. They had to get ready for departure. After arriving there they recived thier seamen's papers and boarded the SS CharlesW.Wooster torward Greece with a of 335 horses plus enough hay oats to feed them. is why I say we should be oeagoing cowboys. Its fun! You can travel the seas and visit lots of placeo while doing what your good at heeping others. Also you dont have to pay for anything if you sign up. Jusi remember all for charity and eo help others. This is my argumentive essay on becoming a seagoing cowboy. Thank you for my essay.",0.9
e_1sb9vj98,-1,"Dear Head,

There are many kids who want to participate in community service and others who do not. I think that students should be required to attend a certain amount of community service in order to graduate. However the amount of hours the students are required to attend should be kept at a minimum.

Students should have to attend a certain amount of community service because it will teach them that it is important to help others. It is important to learn to help others because in the future it will help them mature, and become a better person.

Community service is also important because it will give students a chance to see what kinds of jobs they would and wouldn't like to do in the future. This way they would have a easier time choosing their careers.

The required amount of community service should be minimal because it will still give the students a chance to do what they want. Although it is important to help others it is also important to be independent. Students must be able to express themselves in order to be independent and that should not be taken away from them.

In conclusion, students should be required to attend a certain amount of community service, however it should be kept at a minimum. This is because it will help them mature as a person, give them an idea of what they would like to do in the future, and still give them a chance to do what they want.",0.0

e_ij8zh2uj,4,"Driverless cars aren't a good idea because, it's a waste of money. Driverless cars aren't helpful to people because of the way they look when they are in the real world. In a driverless car think about the things that would be done if they were in that situation. That's the question, that is what people want when they know that it is not safe. We will have to rely on technology to drive us from place to place. The reason is, we have so much technology and we need to figure out all the possible things we should be using for other things as well. Why is it bad to make Driveless Cars?

First off the question is will it be useful in 2030 years. We're just trying to figure it out, alot of things that aren't used to help us with other stuff. How is it helpful for people to be able to get around in traffic and accidents? It wont have to do anything. Why would we need to invest money on something we can use for other purposes? We could use the money to buy stuff for the homeless or maybe build something for them. So many questions you know why, its new first of all people like new things, like cars, phones, hunting rifles, etc... we want new inovations to drop and when someone reads a newspaper clip stating "" Google's cofounder invented driveless cars"". The people love that type of things and whats gets them move interested is when you give them details, the new functions, and the accsessability you have in a car that you don't need to drive.

Secondly, the idea of using driverless car is a waste of money do to how much we have invested in it. We can get new inovations that people don't need to be in. People can use this to get things done at school, work, and places like work places. When the money comes in the form of money you can spend it for other things or for money like that. That's good for the community we just have to use the funds for something else.

Finally, we don't need driverless cars why not just use them for things like, shopping, food, gas, etc. Driverless cars need alot of fuel and we can do that at the same time we have the money to buy things for other things that arent needed. The self diving car can only get you one step ahead and thats just what it would take for us to be making the driverless car.

The idea of driverless cars is interesting. I would love to know why it isnt such a waste of money. There are so many good things in this story it really makes me think they're worth it in the end.",0.7
e_pxngucep,6,"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in terms of density and size. One of the National Aeronautics an Space Administration are trying to send humans to study Venus. They are trying figure out a solution where the humans they send can be in a floating vehicle or some kind of way they can study Venus without Being on the plant. If they were to be on the plant they would be burning up because of how hot Venus is the degrees are around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

The first reason I pulled from the article explains a very good idea through this quote, ""NASA's possible soultion to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. This would be an amazing idea being in some kind of spacecraft just on the ouside of the atomosphere of venus to take pictures and such so humans could map out the surface more. The next parpgraph in the article has a contridiction this is quote explains it ""However, peering at from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provdide limited insdight on the ground.

e_yo1b465s,-1,"Should distant learning be offered for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? Yes, because this option would benefit students who can't aren't allowed to leave their homes by engaging them in the same material someone would learn in a physical classroom. Distance learning could also benefit people in more rural or remote areas who don't have access to a proper classroom education. On the other hand, students could take advantage of online classes in a negative way. Distractions like video games, hanging out with friends, and sleeping in are some ways online learning can be taken advantage of, and that student is not getting a proper education nor benefiting from online learning.

Distance learning can benefit people everywhere and give people a proper education without leaving their home. The people looking into distant learning are people who can't leave their home, people in remote areas, and students who just don't want to go to a physical school. Students on house arrest or incarceratedcould get an education without posing a threat to themselves or others. Also, educating people that are in prison could greatly help them when they finish their sentence. Having a high schoolor college degree would allow them to get a job, stay on the right path, and not end up back in jail. Students with a disability who cannot leave their home can benefit in the same way and receive a proper education without leaving the comfort of their home. Lastly, people in remote or rural areas who don't have access to a physical school building could also get an education they would not have gotten without distant learning.

On the other hand, students could take advantage of online classes in a negative way. Distractions pose to be the biggest issue because it prevents students from getting the full learning experience by taking their focus away from the material. Electronics are the biggest issue, because everyone in today's world has a smart phoneor laptop, and they are always glued to it. When you are at home there won't be a teacher there to tell you to get off your phone or take it away, and a lack of authority will make it easy to lose focus and not pay attention to the material. lastly, not having to wake up every morning to take the bus or drive to school will allow you to sleep in, this will most likely promote laziness and destroy your work ethic.

In conclusion, distance learning will benefit people who can't leave their home, in jail, use it properly, be attentive, and have self discipline by staying away from distractions. But for people that want to take advantage of online learnign in a negative way can do it at the cost of their own education.",0.0
e_pto4jd36,2,"Was there a man on Mars? Magazines say there might have been but it has only been a hypothesis. The Face on Mars is just a natural occurance and has no life to it.

In paragraph three it states,"" A rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. So many people thought that the Martian ""Face"" was caused by aliens. In paragraph five it says,"" There must have been an alien monument, but how to make sure""? This is where many theorists think there should've been proof of an unknown life form. But NASA had some good evidience as stated in paragraph ten stating,""The image first appeared on a JPL web site."" Which is the official websight run by NASA.

Many theorists and scientists may believe and agree with each other as they believe NASA is hiding things but not much evidence supports theorists claims. In paragraph thirteen it states,"" Many conspiracy thoeries suggest a NASA cover up to hide any evidence of life on Mars. But scientists at JPL say there is no sign nor are there evedence to support those claimas."" There's nothing wrong with being a conspiracy theorist because you have a reason behind it but don't make up lies just cause.

In paragraph seventeen NASA unveiled a better image using the highest pixel counts to prove that it isn't an aelien mark, it's actually a natural land formation. In paragraph fifteen it states,"" Thoerits believe NASA would rather hide any alien marker found on the surface of Mars."" Many theorists will never agree with any claims made by NASA but there's evidence to prove their wrong. Even if NASA hasn't proven them wrong there is still theorists that won't agree with the NASA and their claims and proof that the Face on Mars didn't have any alien markes because it's natural land form.

Conclusion, the Face on Mars is only a natural land form and has no connection to aliens.",1.0
e_ai3l4bhl,0,"All arround the world countries are making an effort to reduce their use of cars to benefit the Earth. There are many benefits to reducing car usage all arround the world. Not only does it reduce pollution but it also promotes getting out and being active. Vauban, Germany is a carfree community where the voices of a few children can drown out the hum of a car. Bogota, Colombia has established a program called the Day Without Cars where they promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. This promotes people to use transportation that runs on manpower like bikes or even walking. This also falls into the fact that as people use bikes and walk they begin to get more exercize. Although most of the time it is more continent to use cars to get to a location some places have stores within walking distance so there would be no need for the use of a car.

Pollution has been a problem arround the world for many years, each country is responsible for their own share of polluting the Earth and cars are part of the problem. Cars alone are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in America, if Americans made an effort to reduce that number by just half it would mean a world of difference to that country. It would result in America being less responsible for the pollution of the Earth and a safer environment for the citizens. However, other countries have been taking action to help the environment, efforts were thrown towards cities to make it more beneficial to walk and they are now setting their sights on suburbs. Vauban, Germany is acommunity where there is an advanced experiment that focuses on eliminating the use of cars. Their efforts have proven quite successful as only 30 percent of the families that live there own cars and almost 60 percent of the residents sold their car in order to live there. Bogota, Colombia has created a day where everyone is encouraged to use bikes and walk instead of using fuelburning cars, those who chose not to participate in this event were fined 25. The effort that was put into the making of thisevent has inspired other countries like Cali and Valledupar to do the same. This shows that people are making an effort to move torards environmentally beneficial habits that cause a chain reaction.

Another benefit to reducing the use of cars is that people will get more exercize than they usually do. For some people the most exercize they get is the walk from the couch to the fridge or the 30 minutes when they are at the mall. Unfortunatley, people do not walk arround the mall every day for their daily exercize routine. Decreasing the use of cars would promote people to use their physical energy in order to get to their desired destination. This would also result in having stores and other services of use closer by so people will be more willing to walk to them.",0.0
e_5robi40m,2,"The Face on Mars is Not an Alien Structure

Many people see the striking features of the socalled ""Face on Mars"" and jump to the conclusion that it must be an artificial structure built by ancient aliens. However, upon closer examination of the evidence, it becomes clear that the Face is simply a chance formation of natural landforms. 

Firstly, higher resolution images from later Mars missions show that the Face lacks precise geometric features that we would expect from an artificial object. Its outlines are blurred and undefined, more resembling the eroded edges of rocks and mesas. If aliens had constructed it, we would see clean, straight lines and right angles, not the soft, varied contours that are observed. 

Secondly, similar landforms are found elsewhere on Mars and other planets where there is no possibility of ancient civilizations. Later images reveal countless hills on Mars that resemble faces or animals purely by coincidence of erosional patterns. The socalled ""Dali Sphinx"" on Mars looks remarkably like Salvador Dali's painting, yet was clearly shaped entirely by natural winds and weathering over vast timescales. Planetary scientist also point to corallike features on Venus that resemble human shapes but were undisputedly formed below the boiling surface with no intelligence involved.

In conclusion, while pareidolia makes the Face on Mars look like something recognizable to our brains, the preponderance of evidence points to it being an ordinary hill whose vaguely anthropic appearance is simply due to natural erosional forces slowly sculpting Martian bedrock over hundreds of millions of years. Absent clearer geometric features or other archaeological indications, scientists have found no compelling proof that forces beyond natural geology were involved in its formation. Though intriguing at first glance, closer analysis reveals the Face to be just another naturallyformed mesa, without need to invoke visitation by ancient spacefaring civilizations.",1.0
e_ukel2y4t,4,"No, 100% no, driverless cars should not be created. There are way too many things that can go wrong. I personally think that this would be a bad idea to the community.

The first reason that i think driverless cars should not be created is because what if they are driving on the wrong side of the road and they hit a car that is on the right side of the road. That is a huge risk to the community. Also, the technology could malfunction and the car could go flying off the road and crash. The cars are not completely driverless, they still need the driver to drive them, the technology could malfunction and they could crash into another vehicle.

The second reason that i think driverless cars should not be created is because the technology can fail and cause a huge car accident. They are still not completely driverless so that can be very dangerous for the community. The technology could also just stop working and that would be a huge disaster.

The last reason that i think that driverless cars are a horrible idea is because the cars are not even really driverless. There is still a driver involved. The car still needs a human being to drive it. If the driver is sleeping or not paying attention that is a huge problem. If the car stops working and the person is not paying attention to the road, they could get into a huge accident and hurt someone.

My conclusion to this is that driverless cars are not a good idea. It is very dangerous and it can cause a huge disaster in the community. They are not completely driverless, the technology could fail and the cars could crash. The cars are not really driverless, so that can cause a huge problem.",1.0
e_w7o8pq8g,1,"I think we should get rid of the electoral college because it is easier to understand and will be a lot more realistic.

It is easier to understand if we vote by popular vote, because it will not have to worry about many electors that may or may not even vote for the presidential canidate. It is easy to confuse voters when voting for their candidate and their state's electors Source 2. This can also lead to misjudgment of voters and the votes could end up being rigged or not. Also, if we were to switch the system to election by popular votes, this would be much easier than using the electoral college source 1. This would help in the election process because in source 2 it is a much smaller state and less populated but the majority of the state was represntative. While this may have been some of the biggest election crisis in a century,but i don't believe that they are cheating. This would be a problem to many people. The people should have more power. It is not fair for one person to control the electons. They should be the people to decide the election. It is very unfair that we have the right to vote for who we want as president, but we can do better by voting by popular vote.

To wrap it up, the Electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The best way of voting is to vote by popular votes because it is simpler, more accurate and is fair and will give voters another opportunity to change their mind. I believe that we should change to using the popular vote and not the electoral college.

e_7y9beked,-1,"Dear principal,

I think students should only be required to perform community service if they would like, or have time to. Not all people like to help the community and it would be hard for them to participate in something they don't want to do. For other students who love to help out the community in which they live, they should do community service.

For example some people may have a busy family schedule after school hours or on the weekends. It may be a complication if they had to fit other activities in their daily schedule. It would be only fair to understand family schedules.

Another example is that many other students have school activities after school that they are already dedicated to. Community service could interfere with allowing people to do more of what they want with their lives.

Lastly, some students who live in the community may like where they are but don't think they could be of any help. No one should have to do community service they don't want to. They could already be doing something small to help out but not everyone has time to do something big.",0.0
e_y5veban6,3,"I think that you should join seagoing cowboys program because it is an opportunity of a lifetime. You get to see and experience new things. The text says "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Also in this article it said Luke Bomberger was 18 when he arrived at Greece, which means that if your not 18 yet you can still go on the trip as long as you are turning 18 before it ends. It also states that if your doing this job and its like part time, then you will have more time for your family or friends and your housework may be done faster.

The second reason i think that you should do this programe is because you could help someones life out by helping them with their needs after World War II ended. In paragragh 2 it says "" UNRRA hired 'Seagoing Cowboys' to take care of horses, young cows,and mules who were shipped overseas."" So they would need help feeding them, cleaning up there messes and keeping them safe until we find where to put them all off to give back to their owners. This would really help those families out.

Then finally you should sign up becuase it might change how you live forever. If you start working hard at something, then maybe once this is over you will want to keep doing what you did so much then you decide to try another job. Maybe even work for NASA or the United States Air Force. Or even just stay at that same job but work harder. Just imagine whats going to happen to the world once you stop trying. People won't know what to do with themselves without trying. And once you try again, you will never stop trying ever again. Even if your old. But if your don't try then nothing good will come from you. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program. Because if you dont try now, then you wont even try later.",0.9

I think that the students should be allowed to have their cellular devices during free time and lunch periods. Why? Because some of the kids might need them for an emergency reason such as a fire in the building or maybe if they don't feel well enough to eat lunch. I also know that most people use there cell phones when they are bored so what better way than to use it while you are doing nothing like eating lunch or waiting for class to start. The other policy would make the children more upset because they will not be able to text or call their friends which is why we go to public schools like this one anyway. If I was in charge here I would let us bring our phones but only turn them off unless its a real emergency. Just my opinion on this issue though. Thanks for reading this letter.",0.9
e_uwqz7ohq,-1,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

I think this new school policy is great! Students with a grade C average should not be able to participate in sports or other activities. It makes students have to earn the right to play sports and do other activities. If they don't learn in the classroom, then they won't learn on the field. Also, students with a grade C average are not that smart. They might do dumb things at the activity and ruin the fun for others.

Students must earn the right to play sports and do other activities. They can't get a free pass out of jail. This isn't monopoly, this is life. When the students grow older, they have to earn everything they get. They don't get free money. They don't get a free house. They don't get a free car. Students should start to earn their way through life starting right now. If they don't start now, then they won't start later, and they'll have a miserable life.

Students must learn in the classroom before they step onto a field. They can't play sports without a brain. To get into a good college and play on their sports team, the students first need to have a brain. Then they need the athletic skills to back it up. Also, what will they do if they don't get to the big leagues? If the students didn't learn in school, then they get to live on the streets. Otherwise, they will get a good job and be happy.

Students with a grade C average are not that smart. Some will ruin the fun for others at the school activities. For example, a student who has a D average might think that starting a food fight at a carnival to cause ruckus will be fun. They didn't have the brain to realize that it will cause chaos and bring the whole place down.

So some people might disagree. They might say that some students that have a C average are really good athletes, and if they don't make the team, then the team will fail. Well that's too bad. Like I said, students need to earn it. I don't care if the team will perform poorly without the star player. This might motivate them to do better in school, and then everyone will win. Also, some people might say that they can't do any better. Their parents were dumb, and so were they. Look at that selfconfidence. Change that pattern. If your parents aren't that smart, then you become smart, so that your kids will be smart.

The new policy is a great idea Mrs. Principal. I think it will help students become educated. and it will bring the school average up. So go ahead! Make this new policy official! It will help the lives of so many students!

e_f7vsxhby,3,"Have you ever thought of joining the Seagoing cowboys? If not, I will tell you some things that are good about it. There are many more reasons to join than just these three but these are the ones that really stood out to me after reading this story. The first reason is that they take care of animals on their way over seas and then bring back supplies for people in need. My second reason would be that if you like going places or seeing new places, this job has you go around the world at least once. And my last reason is that you get a chance to help people who have nothing left. This all makes you feel very accomplished when you know you helped someone else even though you didnt do much.

The first thing to look at was helping animals. You might think how could being an animal keeper make your life better, well it does! For example, what if one day while working as an animal keeper you met someone important who later became your boss because you worked with him before. That happened to Luke Bomberger he ended up working for the UNRRA. Also, there were times where he didn't work so he got to explore places he had never been to before. He also said he went sightseeing every place he visited. Some other jobs involve checking on horses, young cows, mules, etc. They check on them twice a day to give them food water and bedding. But most importantly, they keep everyone safe from harming themselves. So those are the benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

My next point is traveling around the world. In fact, you can travel the world twice, depending on whether you are heading eastbound or westbound. One time, Luke crossed the Pacific Ocean 16 times. Now thats alot of miles. Another perk of getting to see different countries is meeting people from different countries. It also gives you time to explore different cultures and foods. After World War II, Europe was in ruins. To help rebuild the land, America joined together with Europe and formed the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, known as UNRRA. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cattle, and mules that were shipped overseas. Thats exactly what Luke signed up for. Lastly, that was another benefit of becoming a seagoing Cowboy.

Lastly, helping people in need. Many people dont understand how hard it must be to lose everything you own. Imagine losing your house, your car, your family. All gone in a matter of seconds. That is why we should try our best to help others in need by donating clothes or toys or anything that can be used. We can also volunteer for charity events such as food drives, toy drives, cleanups, etc. It feels great when you help someone else. When Luke was crossing the Atlantic Ocean, he found time to play baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittling, reading, and games to pass the time until they reached their destination. In conclusion, helping others is something you always want to do no matter what situation you are in.

In conclusion, those were my top 3 reasons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Helping animals, visiting other countries, and helping people in need are all wonderful experiences you will cherish forever. Join today and start making memories with friends, loved ones, and strangers alike. Lets save the earth one person at a time.",0.9
e_l1vkjvc4,-1,"Online teaching has a been a staple for an advancement,not only for technology but education. Progression has been pushed further through the recognition of technology and it's impact on everyday life. Due to the increase in usefulness of phones and laptops education has been reforming itself to adjust to said changes by implementing itself in technologies wide range. I agree with the idea of online courses and video conferences would benefit students. Change is required to excel in all things including education and its usefulness such as manageability,efficiency,and one on one teaching.

An online course isn't restricted to a daily schedule and due to that you can schedule classes that work with your availability or when your less busy. Some people are restricted by travel for education which could either be it's costly or the schools locally aren't very good for them while online schooling has no need for travel. So if someone wants to do a specific job that isn't taught in their area they can take online courses. The availability of online courses is one of it's most praised features thanks to it being able to be done anywhere such as:Cafes,on the road,hotels for if your on vacation,etc. An online course would be a benefit for someone who has large priorities like the military or an athlete due to them having to move a lot.

Online courses are productive for work being donedue to online course allowing work to be done anywhere,anytime. While doing school at a public facility is filled with mistakes such as teachers misplacing work or procrastinating to deal with grades. An online course can hold onto your grades so you or your teacher never misplace them. Classes are far easier to take online as well because, your able to take a multitude of classes that may not be focused on locally. While taking online courses you have the ability to focus on other things as well without the foreshadowing of work that needs to be done,as stated with athletes they can worry about practice and training without worrying for having to get ready for classes and running back and forth.

Video calls have been an extraordinary leap in technology while also influencing education. Video conferences are the best opportunity for one on one teaching and it's ability of privacy. You can be able to have your teacher show you the way to execute problems and solve them while being able to answer your questions you may have. Being taught by someone is experience needed for growth and its exceptionally helpful for comprehending a subject you may struggle with. The privacy and seclusion of online courses is beneficial for a less embarrassing experience if you struggle with a question which can boost confidence in the long run.

An Online course is a thing students should take advantage of when given the chance due to its usefulness. Technology and education are moving forward,creating more ways for a student to learn and comprehend their interests. Time and willingness to learn are the things needed for education and the ability to excel in it. Video conferences are the best way to have a subject unfold before you and to understand it properly while having the ability to have your teacher there for you. Online courses will always be needed for someone is excessively busy or unable to travel as much,so they will always be need.",0.0
e_81x1befe,-2,"Introduction:
The current wealth distribution patterns in the United States have sparked significant debate and scrutiny. This essay aims to analyze these patterns, specifically focusing on the underpayment of registered nurses RNs and the overpayment of National Football League NFL players. Utilitarian ethics will serve as the guiding framework, emphasizing the need for compensation to align with the degree of social importance. Strategies for addressing this injustice will be evaluated, including limiting NFL players' wages, imposing profit use rules on sports entities, and petitioning for legislative action to increase minimum wages for RNs.
Wealth Distribution Patterns in the U.S.:
The wealth distribution in the United States highlights stark disparities between different professions and occupations. According to recent data, the wealthiest 1% of Americans hold a significant portion of the nation's wealth, while the income of the average American has stagnated in comparison. This disproportionate distribution raises questions about social equality and the fairness of compensation across various industries.
Underpayment of Registered Nurses:
 Registered nurses play a critical role in society, providing healthcare services and maintaining the wellbeing of individuals. Despite their immense social importance, RNs often receive inadequate compensation. This undervaluation stems from factors such as gender bias, lack of collective bargaining power, and corporate profitdriven healthcare systems. Utilitarian ethics argue that by undervaluing RNs, we undermine public health and overall societal wellbeing.
Overpayment of NFL Players:
The NFL is a lucrative industry that generates billions of dollars annually. Under the current wealth distribution patterns, professional football players often receive salaries that far exceed their social contributions. While football provides entertainment and promotes a sense of community, it does not carry the same degree of social necessity as healthcare. Utilitarian ethics suggest that misaligning compensation with social importance perpetuates inequality and fails to maximize overall happiness and societal benefit.
The Necessity of Aligned Compensation:
Utilitarian ethics emphasize the need for compensation to align with the degree of social importance. By ensuring fair wages that reflect the value and significance of certain professions, we foster motivation, job satisfaction, and increased overall societal wellbeing. Moreover, fair and equitable compensation contributes to increased productivity, enhanced worker performance, and reduced income inequality.
Strategies for Correcting Injustices:
1. Limiting NFL Players' Wages: Implementing a wage cap or limitations for NFL players could ensure a more equitable distribution of earnings within the sport. This could redirect excess funds towards socially important causes, such as healthcare, education, or poverty alleviation.
2. Imposing Profit Use Rules on Sports Entities: Requiring sports organizations, including the NFL, to allocate a specific percentage of their profits towards socially important initiatives would reallocate wealth to areas where it is most needed. This approach would harmonize corporate success with societal responsibility.
3. Petitioning for Legislative Action to Increase Minimum Wages for RNs: Lobbying for legislative reforms that increase the minimum wages for RNs would address the underpayment issue directly. This measure would recognize the social importance of healthcare, mitigate wage disparities, and provide financial security to those in critical professions.
Conclusion:
Analyzing the current wealth distribution patterns in the United States highlights the underpayment of registered nurses and the overpayment of NFL players as evident examples of societal injustice. Utilitarian ethics reinforce the need for compensation to reflect social importance accurately. To rectify these imbalances, strategies such as limiting wage caps for NFL players, imposing profit use rules on sports entities, and advocating for legislative action to increase minimum wages for RNs must be explored. Achieving economic fairness and ensuring that compensation aligns with societal contributions are essential steps towards a more equitable society.",1.0
e_su4hyd9f,2,"The face on mars could not have been made by aliens because as I read in the article it was just a natural landform. When you think about it, in paragraph 6 it states that it looks like an alien has seen the face but how does that even work? I am going to tell you the facts that I will show you. In this article I have read about NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft which is taking photos of it in different parts of the planet called the Mars Global Surveyor. We do not belive that it was made by aliens, but we do have proof that the face on mars was just a natural landform.

Many people might say that it was made by aliens but I also belive that it isnt aliens because if a person was to have seen one one they could have thought it was just another Martian mesa. I have no evidence that it is an alien. So i do not know how it got there. I also know that there is no sign of aliens going around mars so we can't judge a face by how small it was. They have not claimed that they did something unusual with the face so they could have been there and if you were going to be one of them, we would have already found it out. It did not happen by any means.",0.7
e_vieamifk,4,"Driverless cars are cars that will drive on its own, but they still need a driver right now for problems that happen and that needs a human, but are quickly become less reliant on humans for parts of the driving. Many different companies like Google and Volvo are making and testing driverless cars and there are some that we pass by everyday and we don't even know it.

Driverless are a good thing for everyone, for example you are a busy person and have a long drive to work? Well you can work one that long drive getting mroe things done, and when the car needs your assistance, you are there. They can help the enviroment because they can find the shortest route to the place you are going by GPS. And car accidents will decrease by a large amount if everyone, or almost everyone, drove driverless. Right now all of Googles car haven't crashed once except when another human driver hit them. Also if someone is a long road trip by themselfs they will get tired, that is a big cause of car crashes, but if driverless cars then the driver won't have to drive the car while tired on major highways, also reducing accidents. If we adopted driverless then there would be a taxtridesharing for everone, just say you need a car and one will come and pick you up. Another big casue of crashes and deaths if drinking and driving, but with driverless car it will keep people under the influence from driving on roads and making the roadways a safer place for everyone. As our lives keep advancing, so does technology, and this technology and help us learn, live better lifes, be safe, and so much more. And driverless cars are just part of this technology push. Cars are another step to making our lives better. Most rockets and other veichles that go into space that carry people, supplys, and other objects are mostly automated by computers. If a computer can take a veichle to Mars, Pluto, the Moon. Then why can't it take us down the street. As time advances driverless cars will get better and safer for everybody involed. So why hasen't the world adopted driverless cars for the better of everybody? If more money was put into the research and production of driverless cars then they would be even better and safer.

All in all driverless cars are for the betterment of people and the advancement in technology. With more research going into driverless cars with big names behind it like, Google, Apple, Tesla, Volvo and more. Then why does it seem like the world isn't fully behind driverless cars yet. Once laws are passed and more driverless cars are put onto the roads the hopefully everyone can see why drivercars are good for the world and simply amazing.",0.0
e_bdn41wx5,2,"The unmasking the face on Mars is nt a face. You have to understand that this image on the mars had to be a natural landform because of several reasons.

First, the image does not have a face structure. You can tell because that face in the image had no jaw bone or eye balls or even a mouth. It was just a structure of a big lava dome and it made a formation that made it like it made a face.

Second, I had to tell you this, you know why? because in all of space you don't see any images like this of a face on anything. It has to be the same way on planet mars.

Last, I will tell you that there is no chance that it was a face there has to be something that caused the cracks on mars. Because if you think that is a face then think that the whole surface of mars is the human face or is there an alien that we have to search every single corner of that planet to find it.

But as you can see from this information I gave you. It tells you that it must have been natural and it wasn't a human face that was made in mars. There is not a chance that a face was made in that place because if they had you had a face that would be in other side of mars because there are a lot of different planets.

e_6aaqe9qy,1,"Dear state senator, i have sent you this letter to tell you that the Electoral College is a great method of selecting the president, because it isn't the way the president is selected it's by the vote of the Electoral College. The president is chosen by the most popular votes because they know that they will win. This is a good way of voting for presidents if we keep the Electoral College. In source three it states that in the 2000 presidential race, seventeen states didn't get the chance to see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. In fact, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which the canidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

When you vote for president your really voting for your candidate's electors. The reason is, the larger the state the more they know what their doing. In addition, if a president isn't from your state he will try to gain the trust of the people on their side. The winnertakesall system is good because it avoids the runoff elections, where candidates can focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states.",0.7

e_9dk4t6kb,-2,"A range of approaches can be used to efficiently synthesize 1,2diamines from diazetidines, including asymmetric lithiationelectrophilic substitution, cycloaddition, and photochemical reactions. Diazetidines are versatile building blocks as they can undergo a variety of bondbreaking and bondforming reactions. 

Asymmetric lithiation followed by electrophilic substitution is an effective way to generate 1,2diamines. Lithium alkoxide bases can selectively abstract a proton from just one of the two neighboring methines, leading to an asymmetric anion which can react stereoselectively with electrophiles such as alkyl halides. The resulting organolithium intermediate can then be protonated to yield 1,2diamines with high diastereocontrol. The mechanism of deprotonation and electrophile addition is well understood, but recent research has explored more sterically hindered alkoxide bases to improve selectivity and yield.

Diazetidine also readily undergoes 22 cycloaddition reactions to form cyclobutanes that can be converted to 1,2diamines. The mechanism involves a photochemical or thermal generation of a diradical intermediate from the double bonds of the alkene and diazetine, followed by radical combination to form the cyclobutane ring. Although this approach requires extra synthetic steps to reduce and cleave the cyclobutane, recent advances in enantioselective cycloaddition and catalysts have improved its efficiency.  

Photochemical 22 cycloaddition using benzophenone sensitizers is a photooxygenation approach to synthesize 1,2diamines.  Ultraviolet light excites benzophenone, which then transfers energy to triplet oxygen, generating reactive singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen can oxidatively cleave the diazetidine double bond, and the resulting hydroperoxide intermediate rearranges to the 1,2diamine. This approach benefits from mild reaction conditions but often gives lower yields due to unwanted side reactions.

In summary, a combination of asymmetric lithiation, cycloaddition, and photooxygenation reactions provide efficient pathways to 1,2diamines from diazetidines with good control of stereochemistry. Purification techniques such as recrystallization, column chromatography, and HPLC afford the final products in high purity for characterization using NMR, IR and mass spectrometry.",1.0
e_spcoqg8d,0,"For many years cars have been one of the top methods of transportation. Cars have been around since the first world war. Cars are all around us all the time. Some people love them and dont. Cars have also caused some people to not like them. In some areas cars aren't so desired they are banned. These types of laws have been poping up all over the world.

In Bogota, Columbia cars are banned for one day a year all the way back to 1990.

Carfree Day reduces smog and promotes alternative transportation. It is a big event in Columbia and in 2006 nearly 3 million Columbians hiked biked, skated or took public transportation. The carfree day is a big success because it reduces air pollution.

If the air pollution is reduced people would be more healthy.

If the pollution is reduced it stops people from getting sick all the time.

It also makes it easier for the government to make rules and laws about pollution.

In Paris, France the pollution is really high and it causes people to suffer.

Congestion is at record amounts.

Pollution is one of the main things that causes air problems such as smog and smog is very unhealthy.

So they made the rule that if there is smog cars would have to stop driving.

Paris banned half the cars that drove to drive for a few days.

The cars are not driving in orders.

The cars driving are even numbered and the other day are the odd number.

If you have an even numbered license plate then on monday you can not drive the car and on tuesday you can drive the car.

If you have a odd numbered licence plate on monday you can drive the car, but on tuesday you can not drive the car.

The fines are 31 dollars in euros.

The fines in france are really high because in order to keep pollution at a more managable level they have to limit the amount of cars on the roads.

There are many ways to stop pollution from getting worse for many of the countries in the world.

One of the main ways to reduce the amount of pollution is by limiting cars on the road and making them stop driving for a few days.

There are many more ways to keep pollution out of the air it just takes work.

You have to limit the amount of cars to reduce the amount of smog in the air.",1.0
e_m2x899bi,5,"The author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System FACS enables computers to identify human emotions. FACS is a coding system that breaks down facial expressions into action units, which can then be measured and analyzed. The article argues that the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

In conclusion the use of this application would have a huge impact on how teachers educate kids and kids should become interested in more things. Educating kids with this new application will probably change the way teachers teach it. This would make the students more excited about the lessons and it will be more interesting for the teachers to learn about. Also teachers will better understand how to teach kids. When students are being taught, they are more likely to actually learn something in class than just reading notes or doing nothing. If we can use this software to tell when someone is bored or bored they will get better grades in the class.

Another reason the software is beneficial is that it can help with student engagement. If a teacher knows that a student is not following along, they can take steps to reengage that student. This could involve changing the teaching approach or offering additional support. The software provides a way to monitor student engagement in realtime. In the article, it mentions how the software can identify mixed emotions. This insight could be crucial for teachers.

The final way that the FACS could be useful is to detect if a given student was sad. There is a rising problem among students, and that problem is mental illness. The most common mental illness is depression, and this program could help with that on some cases. The FACS could help by detecting that the student is sad, and alerting the student's parents, or possibly even a teacher to get in contact with the student, and talk with them about their emotions. This system is obviously not perfect, but it could help detecting early signs of depression among students.

That being said, I do think that the use of FACS technology can be helpful in some cases. For example, if a student is having trouble expressing their emotions, the computer may be able to pick up on some subtle clues from their facial expressions. Additionally, the technology could be used to help teachers to identify students who are struggling emotionally and may need help.",0.6582049668626822
e_321p9n8h,-7,"Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow a a child to continue to learn during time away from a long time at school. However many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed they should be studentdesigned to ensure engagement within the project allow them to grow in a field of interest and give the students an opportunity to express themselves. Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A studentis more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in rather than completing required tasks that they don t want to do. Enacting studentdesigned projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While the can students students, it it also provide a better understanding of students students can help for their students ahead of time keeping them engaged in what they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose. For many students their engagement in an activity comes from the topic allowing them to have freedom as to what they create helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student s who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child s mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves. Finally Summer is defined in a kid s mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student s designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth. In all Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student s if they were designed by student s themselves based on an increase of interest opportunity to grow in a field of interest and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student s will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by selfdesigning an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds.",0.05
e_v2vrd11p,2,"The Face on Mars is jut a natural landform.

In paragraph one it states that it is like mesa,but there is no ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". In paragraph 2 it is also shows that is a mesa,just more pronounced by shadows. In paragraph 4 it shows that there may be other mesas as well. Also in paragraph 12 states that there isn't alien civilization. As we can see we know that this is a mesa.

First, it shows how it may be just a mesa. Paragraph 1, it states that, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Eygptian Pharaoh."" This is saying that it is just another common feature of the Cyndonia on Mars,just happens to have strange and peculiar shadows to look like an ancient Pharoh.

Third, it states that there aren't aliens. In paragraph 2 it says,""There must be an alien monument, said skeptics, ""revealing something about Mars."" This shows that skeptics want it to be a Martian monument because they believe that the world has an ancient civilization of ""alien civilization"". In paragraph 3 it also states that, ""There may have been life on Mars....."" This is a possibility they may have, but a big one.

e_po6qdwzc,1,"I think that they should not change the Electoral College because it tells us what kind of president we will have in the future and what kind of changes he will make. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. You see this is something that happened a long time ago the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This is a system that makes sure that we know what kind of president we are putting in the white house and what are things to make this state a better state to live in and to have a good job. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainments are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

In the article of The Indefensible Electoral College its trying to ask you why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong and it tells you why. What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO all, in their time, agreed on? They were trying to abolishing the electoral college and they were not alone, according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won thwe popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is the thing that can not be changed because this is a system that we can pull up see what they were elected for and why they were voted president and how many times. It helps us how we can choose the right president or the right vice president. In 1960 in Hawaii, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was president over the senate, validated only his opponents electors, but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. This happened a long time before i was born. You see only one state can casts only one vote in Wyoming,representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California,who represent 35 million voters. In 1968,a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the electionin 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters on Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

In a article i read it says that there are five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. There are called Certainty of Outcome,Everyones President,Swing States,Big States, and the final one is Avoid RunOff Elections. Each one tells us how choosing the president and shows us a map how it works and we can see which state shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. This is something that can help us understand how to vote and how long they will be the president or the vice president i think that we should not change the Electoral College because how would it work without it and how would we pick the next president. This is a hard thing because it would take time to discusses it with the senators and it would take a lot of votes to agree or disagree to the idea. This is why i think that they should not change this because its been around longer before i was born.",0.0

He talks about how Venus and Earth have similar conditions. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Even to this day with the climate on Venus it is very hot and has a lot of pressure. But is also like Earth with the conditions that it has and the fact that Venus has ""valleys, mountains, and craters"" it proves that Venus is very similar to Earth. ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" Even to this day with the conditions on Venus he says that they have not had a spacecraft that has lasted more than a few hours on it. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" He also talks about the fact that they have to be really careful with the weather that is on Venus and that they have to be really careful with the extreme heat that is on the planet. ""It can liquefy some metals."" Venus is very dangerous to humans due to the climate and conditions, but if they figure out a way to get to Venus human might be able to live there.",1.0
e_6nsovfhy,4,"A driverless car is a very useful thing in concept.

You would be able to complete objectives other than your own transportatin while being transported.

But that is only provided that you are being taken to your destination without haveing to worry about the transportaion.

The whole point of a driverless car is that you let the car do all the work while you atend to your daily acivities, but the car being adveratised is a half driverless car where any obsticals between point A and point B have to be handled by the user.

As of now, the ""driverless"" car is a wasted investment.

Despite not being very usefull, lets assume someone buys the half driverless car.

They would have to have an incredibly vast amount of welth to do so.

Then if they were the kind of person the advaratisers are adveratiseing to they would keep their eyes on the road and ""enjoy"" the ride, while still having to drive arond obstcals ocasionaly.

So they'd just be doing a more boreing version of driveing.

But not everyone is careful like those people.

Without a doubt, someone would not do their reserch and assume the driverless car is completly selfoperated.

They would get in the car, start it, and then do something that advacates of safe driveing have been trying to stop for years.

Wether it be texting of drinking intoxicating substances, or even cautching up on sleep.

Even the safest person would completly loath the half driverless car due to how boreing it would get.

At least regular driveing allows some interaction between the machine and the driver so the oporator can stay engaged.

The half driverless car is too impractical to be used by anyone

So the half driverless car is out, but what if google or some other car selling establishment was able to succeed in making a completly driverlss car?

Well, it still wouldn't turn out okay.

Every taxi driver, school bus driver, public bus driver,and at some point, maybe even pilot, would be out of a job.

So thousands of people would lose their jobs becausen they were no longer needed to transport people.

This could portentally increse the homeless population and increse the number of people doing illegal things to get by.

In conclusion, the half driverless car would not work safey with most people today, and the driverless car would shrink the job market.

While not bad ideas, they are both incredibly innificent and crossproductive.",0.0

e_trqt2bvz,6,"Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. Venus is sometimes called the Evening Star. It's one of the brightest points of light in the sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experienced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More advanced and robust technologies are required to study the planet's surface. Therefore scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many believe that the potential scientific rewards outweigh the dangers involved in such a mission.

Last NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, they are developing electronics that can withstand the harsh conditions of Venus for prolonged periods. Another project is looking back to an older technology called mechanical computers. These computers are being considered for future Venus missions because they can potentially survive the extreme conditions. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, the author makes a compelling case for the exploration of Venus. I believe the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.",0.5502205107290008

Everybody has there own opinion on this concept , but I am definitely for not letting any children without a B average play in any after school activity or sport there may be .

I think to be able to play after school sports , or be in any after school activity is a privilege and needs to be earned . Its not fair to those who do all there work that others get to play without having to maintain good grades like they have. Also school should always come before any thing else because sure you can make a living playing sports when your older , but you always need to have a back up plan for when that doesn't work because no job is easy to find with out having an education .

However the two countries have worked together in the past to address global security challenges including Iran s nuclear program and the Syrian conflict. The United States and China have a mutual interest in promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region. Cooperation between our two countries is vital especially in preventing escalation avoiding miscalculations and maintaining open communication said Shannon in a statement. The primary focus of the talks will be on North Korea s nuclear program which presents a significant threat to the entire region. The U.

China which is North Korea s closest ally has also supported sanctions on the country but has been accused of not doing enough to control its neighbor s nuclear ambitions. The U. S. hopes to gain China s full cooperation in pushing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The talks between Shannon and his Chinese counterparts are expected to be frank and open with both sides expressing their concerns and discussing possible solutions to the challenges facing the region. The U. S. officials can see China s idea on things that will prevent arms conditions falling into a wrong and and and the importance of our and and and norms. The outcome of the talks will be watched closely by the global community as any breakthrough in the effort to curb arms proliferation will have far reaching implications. Both the U.

e_u2vl02iz,-2,"GM U.S. Plants Face Shutdowns and Delay of New Models as Canadian Strike Continues 

General Motors is facing shutdowns at several U.S. assembly plants and delays in the rollout of important new vehicles like the Chevrolet Corvette as a strike by Canadian auto workers enters its third week. The dispute has idled nearly 10,000 GM workers in the U.S. and Mexico who depend on components supplied by the GM factory in Oshawa, Ontario. The shutdowns are rippling through the North American auto manufacturing supply chain and threatening to pinch GMs profits if the strike continues for much longer.

The United Auto Workers union, which represents 48,000 GM workers in the U.S., called the Oshawa strike in early September after GM announced plans to close the factory, a move that would eliminate 2,100 jobs. The UAW is demanding that GM keep the Oshawa plant open or transfer some of the work to U.S. factories. But GM says the factory is outdated and expensive to operate, and it has no plans to allocate more products to Oshawa. 

 GM halted production this week at factories in Ohio, Indiana and Mexico that make the Chevy Equinox, GMC Terrain and Cadillac XT4 SUVs, all of which depend on parts from Oshawa. GMs plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, which builds the iconic Corvette sports car, had to shut down and delay the launch of the new midengine Corvette by at least a month. The Corvette plant closure resulted in 1,200 temporary layoffs.

The spate of shutdowns is putting pressure on both sides to reach an agreement and end the standoff. While vehicle inventory levels remain healthy for most models, some dealers are starting to report dwindling supplies of models like the Equinox. There are also concerns about the longterm impact on customer loyalty if buyers have to wait months for their new vehicles or switch to competing brands.

GM said that it has offered several proposals to the UAW to shift additional work to Oshawa, including potential electric vehicle programs, but that none are viable alternatives to the current plan to close the plant at the end of the year. The company is urging the UAW to instead focus on negotiating job placement and retraining for affected workers. But the union maintains that GM has a moral obligation to allocate new vehicle programs to Oshawa to save jobs.

As the costs and disruption from the Oshawa strike continue to rise, pressure is building on both sides to find a compromise and bring GMs Canadian and U.S. operations back to full speed. But after weeks of failed negotiations, a resolution that satisfies both the unions demands and GMs business interests remains elusive. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether GMs North American manufacturing network returns to normalor faces further upheaval.",1.0

It is my privilege to write about the importance of limiting car usage. I believe that this is an important issue that we as a society must consider.

One of the most important reasons to limit car usage is the effect that it has on the environment. Cars are very wasteful machines. They use a lot of energy to move around, and they produce a lot of pollution. Pollution from cars can damage the environment and make it difficult for people to breathe.

Another important reason to limit car usage is safety. Cars are dangerous machines. They are responsible for a lot of deaths and injuries. If we want to keep our citizens safe, we need to make sure that they are not driving cars.

Finally, I believe that limiting car usage is economically beneficial. It is cheaper to use public transportation or bikes than to use cars. It is also cheaper to live in a city or town that has a good public transportation system.

I think that these are all very good reasons to limit car usage. I hope that you will consider these reasons when making decisions about how to use cars. Thank you for your time.",1.0

e_dh78zr2n,-1,"The Dangers of Cell Phone Usage while Driving

Over the years cell phones have been a key part in most people's daily lives. Cell phones can be used as means of communication, internet surfing, work, etc. While cell phones can be very beneficial in people's daily lives, they can cause much harm when used at the wrong time, such as when driving. Everyday people are dying in car accidents due to using their cell phones. Driving while using a cell phone is among the leading factors of car accidents, which can be fatal. Despite the danger, people still use cellphones while driving. Truthfully, cell phone usage while driving should be made illegal because it serves as a major distraction and can cause harm to others as well as the driver.

Numerous studies have shown that people who are distracted by their cellphones while driving are more likely to cause or be involved in accidents. The CDC estimates cell phone usage while driving causes onethousand injuries and nine deaths a day. The reason is clear the driver is not fully focused because they are distracted by their cell phones. This is extremely dangerous because the driver has their eyes off the road. A study from NHTSA revealed taking your eyes off the road for five seconds at fiftyfive mph is equivalent to driving an entire length of a football field with your eyes closed. While looking at a phone while driving causes one to not have their eyes on the road, the use of a cell phone also decreases the driver's reaction time. A psychologist by the name of David Strayer once stated the reaction time of a 20yearold using a cell phone while driving has the same reaction time of a 70yearold driver who is not using a cell phone. It is clear cell phone usage while driving decreases one's reaction time greatly, while also prohibiting the driver from being fully focused on the road. This information should not sound new, people are quite aware of the dangers, yet it still takes place.

As mentioned, people know the dangers of cell phone usage while driving, especially teenagers. The dangers of distracted driving is fresh in the mind of new teenagers on the roads because they have just finished driver's education. Although teenagers know the dangers of distracted driving, 21% of teenage drivers are killed annually due to cell phone usage while driving. This makes me wonder why the number of crashes involving teenagers using cell phones are so high? The clearest answer is their parents. As teenagers ride with parents, legal guardians or adults who use their cell phones while driving, it makes the concept seem a bit more normal and okay. Personally I feel the reason many adults use their cell phones while driving is because they feel very experienced. People who have been driving for over twenty years are without a doubt typically more experienced than new drivers. While they do have more experience than new drivers, it does not mean they have mastered the task of driving while being distracted by their cell phone. This false idea many adults have leads to teenagers picking up on these habits. Differences could be made if adults did not text and drive, especially with children in the car. It could decrease the number of teen drivers who use their cell phones while driving. While adults not using their cell phones while driving with children would possibly decrease the number of young people driving with cell phones, it also makes the roads safer! That enough should make adults want to stop using their phones while driving. Everyone, teenager or adult, should want to put their phone down while driving to make the roads. This simple act can save thousands of lives per year.

It should not be a hotly debated issue whether or not cell phone usage while driving should be illegal or not. It should clearly be illegal. Consider the thousands of victims killed by distracted drivers each year. Cell phones can be great and helpful but, people need to learn to put them down! If people were not be distracted by their cell phones while driving, the roads would be so much safer. No notification one receives while driving should ever be more important than keeping yourself and others safe.",0.0

Imagine being able to see what people are thinking when they say certain things. It's amazing how far we as humans have come. In my opinion this kind of technology could really change our world.

The author states,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This shows how useful this technology could be for teachers who want their students to get better grades and learn faster. Students wouldn't have to raise there hand every 5 minutes asking questions. They would be able to understand lessons much quicker than before. If a teacher knew when one of hisher students were feeling down heshe could try to find out why and maybe make them feel happier or more confident. With all these benefits schools around the world could benefit from using this type of technology.

This type of technology could also prevent any form of bullying happening in schools today. The article says ""Most human communication is nonverbal"" meaning that most communicating happens through actions such as facial expressions. Say someone has been bullied by another person but doesn't tell anyone about it. The victim might put on a smile everytime the bully comes near himher which makes noone suspicious. But this FACS program will be able to pick up when the victims smile looks fake. This will help teachers identify possible bullying situations sooner rather than later.

So overall i think the use of this technology in classrooms would be extremely helpful and beneficial to both the students and the teachers. Its like having your own personal psychologist with you while doing work. So many great things can happen when using this special kind of technolgy.",0.9
e_urgyerz9,-2,"General Motors Corp. Has Potential Buyer for Four Parts Plants

General Motors Corp. announced today that a potential buyer has emerged for four parts manufacturing plants that GM plans to shut down by the end of 2019. The plants, located in Michigan, Ohio, and Maryland, produce components like engines, transmissions, and other powertrain parts that GM uses in its vehicles. 

GM said it has entered into negotiations with American Parts Holdings, a private equity firm that specializes in acquiring and restructuring auto parts suppliers. If a deal is reached, American Parts Holdings plans to continue operating the plants and supply GM with the components it needs for its vehicles. The plants employ around 3,200 workers combined, so the deal would save hundreds of jobs that were expected to be lost when GM closed the plants.

The potential sale is part of GMs efforts to cut costs by reducing excess capacity in its manufacturing operations. Earlier this year, GM announced plans to close five North American plants, including the four parts plants, by the end of 2019. The move is expected to save GM up to 6 billion by the end of 2020. However, it has faced criticism from lawmakers and unions who argue it will hurt American workers. A deal to sell the parts plants could help alleviate some of those concerns.

American Parts Holdings has a history of acquiring struggling auto parts suppliers and turning them around to profitability. The private equity firm says it sees ""significant value and growth opportunities"" in the plants GM aims to close. If it buys the plants, it intends to secure longterm supply contracts to provide components to GM for its next generation of vehicles, in addition to potential contracts with other automakers. American Parts Holdings has begun a due diligence review of the operations and finances of the parts plants to determine if it wants to move forward with a final purchase agreement. 

The fate of the plants remains uncertain until a final deal is reached. However, GM said it is committed to finding solutions that secure jobs and balance the interests of its various stakeholders with its own business goals. The potential sale of the parts plants appears to satisfy that objective, even as the company forges ahead with its broader restructuring strategy. Bargaining with American Parts Holdings is set to start later this month, with hopes of reaching an agreement to save the jobs by the end of the year.",1.0

But the allure of immortality captured the hearts and minds of countless dreamers, enthralling them with the promises of eternal existence.
In the beginning, people's choices were as diverse as the colors of the rainbow. Each individual focused on their own desires and manifestations of power. The world thrived in a delicate equilibrium, as unique abilities blossomed and intertwined.
But as time passed, whispers began to spread like wildfire through the populace. Stories of immortality's allure echoed from every corner, drawing flocks of hopeful souls. The once vibrant tapestry of powers gradually faded, overshadowed by the overwhelming deluge of immortality seekers.
The effects were palpable. The few who had originally chosen immortality, enjoying lives of endless possibilities, soon found themselves stagnating. Their strength waned, their vitality diminished, until they were nothing more than mere mortals. For the many who had chosen immortality, the power became a hollow semblance of what it once was.
Meanwhile, those who had chosen lesserknown powers were untouched by the curse of popularity. The fire manipulators, the shapeshifters, and the healers grew strong, their abilities flourishing in the absence of competition. They thrived where others floundered, finding strength in their uniqueness.

Depending on the speed at which you're driving, they will be able to run on different speeds and at speeds that they aren't available at all. ""Driverless Cars are the new future of transportation, but also allow for the potential problems of human error."" The use of driverless cars would greatly benefit the world. They would be safer than any car driven on the streets by human drivers.

One of the most significant things we will have in the driverless car is fuel. With the use of fuel, people will use less fuel when driving. In this article, Dr. Richard A. Posner says, ""The cars' driver seats have become vibrate when in need of braking, steering, and accelerating. This means they can do more driving tasks without needing to aviode accidents."" He also explains that the cars he drives are more fuel efficient, which means that these cars will provide us with a way to get to work more. Drivers will know what is going on when they have to navigate through road work and accidents. This quote, while not stating anything, emphasizes how important it is for driverless cars to be safe. These cars will allow for the driver to get up and take over when need to, and not worry about navigating through road work or accidents.

There are countless reasons why driverless cars should be developed. Drivers will no longer have to worry about the distractions of driving. They will be more alert and will pay more attention to the road. The article states, ""The driving fun is a big part of the fun of driverless cars, but not in the long run. They allow the driver to take the wheel when they need to, so they can get home and enjoy life's little pleasures."" This statement shows that drivers are not the most reliable when it comes to getting around accidents, such as dealing with road work and accidents. It is highly likely that people will get bored because of them. Drivers aren't accustomed to doing things they have to do, which may make it more easy to understand and react to traffic issues.

Although driverless cars have a high number of positives, there are too many negatives. The driver must be alert at all times. In the article, it states, ""Recent studies suggest that distracted driving is responsible for 67% of all car crashes in the United States."" However, there are numerous reasons why I believe these cars are extremely useful to our society and should be supported. They are easy to see, safe, and quick. This is just one of the several positives. Drivers will always have to be ready to answer a text or call when in need of help.

In conclusion, it would be a very great idea to have driverless cars built into the roads of today's modern day cars. These cars would allow us to take away the need for humans to get around, have better entertainment, and save us time to drive. I hope that drivers will take the concept to heart and develop these type of cars, which will allow our lives to flourish even more than they do right now. This is all that I need to convey to the world and convince the people that this will greatly benefit our current life. It is imperative that you take action and take it into consideration.",0.7
e_f25b3br2,-2,"I was there when we left our home, all the way back in 20XX,"" I took a sip of my coffee since we've finally almost arrived at mankind's new home our supplies have started to dwindle, and there wasn't really enough coffee left to make a good cup.
""There were lots of us back then, but you know.. Two thousand years is a long time for a normal human being. The average lifespan back in 20XX was give or take 90, sometimes 100. Which probably sounds outrageous now as most of you will probably live till you're my age!"" Everyone laughed, they knew that was impossible.
You see, I'm immortal.
I lived my whole life before keeping my immortality a secret, but that's not easy when you're on a ship with hundreds of thousands of people for the next two thousand years..
It took them about 40 years to start speculating, as by then I was about 70, but I didn't look a day over 30. Even now, 2000 years later I don't want to come off as I'm bragging, but I might even get checked for ID if I were to go to the Market Sector and tried to buy a 6 pack of beer.
""I was there when you were born, and you were born, and when your parents were born, and even their parents. I could go on for 2000 years."" Everyone chuckled again.
""Did you ever get lonely?"" one of the children in the front row asked,
""You know, some people would think living forever might be a gift. I have made many friends, but I've lost just as many."" I pause for a moment. ""I've been in love, I've experienced all there is to life, and even the some more. Loneliness is just another part of life, as is love, heartbreak and death."" I take another sip of my coffee, ""And even still, if I could make the choice to make myself not live forever, I probably wouldn't. The human race interests me, seeing where we all began, and where we're about to end up I couldn't be more excited to experience the next 2000 years.""
""Ladies and gentlemen, if you are in the Lounge Sector of the ship look on your left to see the destination our ancestors have been routing us towards for the last 2000 years. Our new home, The Milky Way!"" The ship's intercom went off, and as did everyone else to go see their new home.
I took a moment to think, ""The Milky Way,"" why does that sound so familiar?

My first ever piece, I never write but I thought I had an idea for this so I wrote it up. Great Prompt OP.",0.0
e_suf9006g,2,"Do you believe in aliens? If so, what is your evidence? In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", conspiracy theorists believe in 1976 the Viking snapped a photo of an alien face on Mars. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor retook the photo of the Face with sharper cameras. The Face on Mars is a natural landform that appeared as an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Cydonia, or Red Planet, revealed unusal shawdows which made the Face look like an Egyptian Pharaoah. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. After released on the JPL web site, the photo revealed a natural landform. Later in 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took another trip to Cydonia on a cloudless summer day. They snapped an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum pixel use. The picture later revealed a Martian equivalent of a butte.

After all of the photos being investigated, the photos revealed a landform shaped like a Face. NASA proved to conspriacy theorists that they were not hiding anything about the Face on Mars. The MOC team also proved that the photos did not show any evidence of an alien face on Mars. Finally, the MGS, NASA, and the MOC teams all revealed the photos to the public on the JPL web site for the public to view and leave there opinion on the Face on Mars.",0.0

The doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3d computer model of the faceall 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic muscles. Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second, your the the the the the the to at the corners of your eyes. Holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile the Zygomatic major muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the corners of your mouth.

e_5h9taker,-6,"Aliens have taken over the world and nothing has really changed. At least that s what many believed at first. The invaders arrived silently their spaceship towering over our cities casting an eerie shadow. But instead of launching a full blown life they merely settled in assimilating seamlessly into our society. The aliens known as the Kristonians resembled humans in every way. They spoke our languages dressed like us and embraced our customs. They held and attended, and even live in life. They were many coworkers, and friends. It was all too surreal. The people watched waiting for the to go to up. When would they reveal their sinister agenda? Days,, weeks weeks and the and the day. Life carried on almost as if the aliens were not present. They did not impose their will upon us nor did they strip us of our autonomy. They became part of our world and allowed us to continue with our lives undisturbed. Curiosity got the out of me and I sought up a Kristonian like Zara. She met me with a warm smile her eyes filled with kindness. We had have our aspirations and our life. Zara was been many people that traveled in galaxies and and and and the life. They had observed our civilization craving understanding and connection. The world of our members were by sharing knowledge and advancing our life. They offered us insights into medicine energy and alternative perspectives on global issues. It seemed that their presence on Earth was more about collaboration than domination. So the world continued to spin and though we shared our planet with extraterrestrial beings we discovered that we were not so different after all. The only change is the widening of our life the is that we in our world.. and friendship and cooperation could transcend barriers terrestrial or alien.",0.95
e_fvjzcta9,5,"In todays world it's getting bigger and better. Were talking about the new technology called Facial Action Coding System, it can help us see the emotions of our students in a more realistic way. Dr. Huang even says that he can tell that shes happy or sad at some point in time. Then there is some cons and negatives on this technology.

Then you can say how well it is. A lot of schools dont really use this technology so I think they might not even know how it works, and that it'snt a good way for people to get better at what they want to do.

If this technology was used to see if kids were bored and confused this might have a positive effect on kids learning. This technology is very useful and will help with kids at schools, so we wont make them feel bad about what they are doing at school. So if the teacher sees that they are confused and needs some help explaining how to do it right. Then the student could get it up to them and modify their lesson so that is good for the lesson. This technology is valuable for teachers because it will help students learn better in class.

In my opinion this technology is very valuable, because it can help many different situations and can be very useful for different types of situations. For example, you can tell when a student is bored or confused with something youre feeling because this technology can help you know if your students are happy, tired, depress, or even tired of just being bored. This technology can also have some cons, like it says it can help you in certain ways. In some ways this technology could not be a good thing, because it say in paragraph 5 that if it isnt wrong then you should give it back to them then they could fix the problem. Its good to have some cons about this technology, but at some point you might have a way of showing it. The way it works today, can be very valuable, because you can read it when its confused and maybe even when youre not really sure what your emotions are. I think this techology could be good for other things as well.",0.7
e_2lztybki,-5,"Studying Venus would be a worhty pursuit despite the dangers because it would provide great information and it is very unique. Venus is like no other planet but if it is so dangerous, why do scientissts still want to go there? The author of ""The Challege of Exploring Venus"" gives several reasons in the text.

One reason is that Venus is Earth's sister planet. It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, and it is sometimes the closest in distance. Even though it is very different now, it may have once been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. According to the text, Venus has ""some planetary features analogous to those on Earth."" This means that even though the conditions are extreme, there is still value in studying a planet that is so similar to ours. This reason is explained well throughout the entirety of the article. The author says, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. astronomers are fascinated by Venus,"" and the value of returning to Venus ""seems indisputable."" The author provides this information to build the reader's understanding that Venus is worth studying, even if it is dangerous.

Another reason is that there is still so much to learn about Venus. The text explains, ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting...provides only limited insight on ground conditions."" Therefore, ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal."" While there are challenges to doing this, the author also notes that there are ways to innovate. For example, NASA is experimenting with ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide"" and ""mechanical computers."" These advances could make it possible to withstand Venus's extreme conditions and gather valuable data about this mysterious planet.

In conclusion, in ""The Challege of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides strong evidence that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is Earth's sister planet and may have once had Earthlike conditions. Scientists still have much to learn about Venus, and they need to get up close and personal to do so. The author cites research being done to make it possible to withstand Venus's extreme conditions, proving that even though Venus poses a challenge, it is a challenge that scientists should be eager to meet.",1.0

e_jppmb4cy,6,"In the article ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"", they are trying to say that we should go explore venus because there are things that earth never has and it is the reason why we need to explore it. One thing they do is that they are trying to find something that we not able to go see on earth but in the artical it says venus might have the hottest surface tempture than other planets in our solar system. The next thing is that they should go and see other thing to see what they might not find in other planets and how we might find new things about it. The next thing is that long time ago venus was use to have thing like earth on it and back then they dont know what we should do about it. they say that venus might have stuff that earth didnt have and we could use it when we come across something like that that we would not have something to use in the future to go and try new things on earth. So we might not want to go to the other planet to see if there are thing on that planet thats why we should go there because they can see the stuff that they have not seen or heard about in the story that the roiling spaceship that has landed on venus in three diffrent years. The next the paraghragh is that if we take samples of the rocks and gases that have been hit by a asteroid we might have something that is similar that earth but we may not have as much idea of what we can do with it. The last thing is that venus might look alot different from earth from other planets they think venus was coverd with large oceans making it look like a valley or moutains and if earth was able to have things like that it might of ben useful to people that live on that planet. So that is why he supports the paraghragh and gives us information of the planet venus and what it is like and why they should go and study it.",0.7
e_49m143x9,-7,Somepeople ask different people for their opinion. Because if you ask different people people can have different opinion and they can have multiple answer. First people have different opinion. When people ask different poeple people have multiple answer. For examole when i want to buy a pair of shoes i ask my mom my dad and sometimes i ask people that i do not know but different people help me to see witch pair of shoes i should pick and there i can see what pair of shoes are the best. somepople do not like to know what other said when i think is better when everybody said their opinion To continue listen other opinion of different people make to choice better. Listen different opinion help us to know what other people think about it. For example my friend always ask me how she looks so she want to know my opinion and she dont only ask me. She ask different people to know their opinion. In the world are 58 of people who want to know other people opinion and their is 52 of people who do not care about what other people think about them. People want to know what other people think. Because that is how people can help to choice the best one. My opinion opinion is knowing what other people will help me to know more about other people think. Finally let people expres their opinion. If people know emotions of other persons help us to pick better. For example sometimes i want to buy a pencil but i like two pencil but i only have money for one. Their is when i need somebody to tell me witch one i should pick. I always tell somebody to tell their opinion. Because their is how people can expres theirself and tell them that is cute or not. Instagram instagram is a social media that a use for a lot of time instagram sometimes help me. Because sometimes when i dont know witch one to pick i post in my storie i put. What shoes i should to pick. and their is when my frieds vote for what shoes i should pick and i can make the best desition. I love to know what other people opinion because that help me to know what other people think about me. In conclusion my opinion is that every person in the world need to listen other person. Because if people have multiple opinion people can have the better choose. Whoever sometimes it is okay to make desition for yourself because sometimes is something personal and people dont know the correct answer and maybe they can be wrong.,0.05
e_lrc5i7wh,0,"In your everyday life, just about anywhere you go you will see people traveling from place to place in their own vehicles. Is the idea of us, as individuals, not owning our own motor vehicles even an option? The idea of not being able to transport where you need to be when you need to be there is a terrifying thought. But, when put into consideration you will find it some what reasonable.

Just think about it, all the toxins released into the air and all the traffic we can be stuck in for hours at a time! Reducing the clutter and the use of oils is enfact very possible. Residents in Vauban, Germany have completely almost completly cut owing cars out of their community. 70 percent of vaughn's family don't own cars while 57 percent sold their cars to move there. With mostly ""carfree"" streets with the exception of the main thoroughfare, Vauban has forbidden driveways and home garages. Though car ownership is aloud if the car owner buys a space to park it, Vauban is leading an example of an alternative way that communities can live reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This example has most certainly envulenced Paris enforcing a partial driving ban. pollution, a large issue in the streets of paris, is being reduced with a driving ban fining anyone who did not leave their cars at home. After five days of this ban, congestion in france was down 60 percent.

Though completely banning cars may be found inconfiniate or extreme, Bogota, colombia, takes place in this uprising craze by devoting one day a year to ""The Day Without Cars"". By doing this they strive to promote alternative transportation and reduce clutter in this capital city. Violators of this event would receive 25 fines. The community who participated in this event have found alternate transportation, and comfort in a break from the clutter. Businessman Carlos Arturo is quoted ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife to get from place to place. As more Colombian citied participate in the event Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the eveny and were enthusiastic. Enriqur Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, paraguay stated that ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"".

These changes are most certainly revolutionary and are changing the way we see our lifes and the way we see transportation. The idea of us working, learning, and living without indivisual automoblies is becoming to look like a huge possibilty. The fact that there are communties taking part in this act, reducing polution and clutter, show that this very well could be part of a change for us and the way we live. With the ownership of automobiles and drivers liscenses going down in america, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilitier Research center, stated that ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift"".",0.0
e_bla2mrp4,-1,"Having students complete a summer project is a wonderful idea as it gets students in the habit of learning, however should these projects be designed by students or teachers? I believe these projects should be administrated and created by students as it provides a more reasonable work load, opportunities for creativity, and helps the students process the information and techniques.

Teachers often don not know how much work is enough work for the student, but who knows more about students than students. If students designed the projects they are more incline to add a reasonable amount of work while still maintaining the recommended or required information. This allows students to participate in the community more and not stress over the huge amounts of work for their projects. This leads to more time for extracurricular activities that in the end help develop these students into better citizens. For example if a student is overwhelmed by the amount of work they have, assigned by the teacher, they then dont have time to volunteer or help out in the community, which in the end effects the future of these students. Teachers could assign a reasonable course load and still achieve the same results, however if students participate in designing the project it then opens up opportunities in creativity.

Due to more time for students to participate in the community it encourages them to add creativity to their projects making it an entertaining and enjoyable experience for them. Teachers often strive for this goal but do not always achieve it due to less communication with the student therefore creating tension and demotivating the student to work. This allows students to express themselves through personal experiences and challenges they faced. A student is more incline to do their project on things they experienced or places they have been. This helps students discover their passion and even in the future their career. For example if a student volunteered at an animal shelter and discovered their love for animals and want to help more, they often base their project on the belief they stand more toward and want to enroll in more veterinary courses in the future. Teachers could encourage students to pursue their goals and appeals through personal help and motivational encouragement. However the student is restricted of these opportunities due to the project and its massive overloaded information that the teacher provided. Student based projects allow creativity to flow which help students remember and use techniques learned in the project.

Through the use of creativity and personal experiences students can learn techniques and information better since it was made by students. This allows for future success and helps students evolve as learners and innovators. The goal of the project is to maintain the habit of learning however, by introducing a more creative experience students learn more and use techniques learned in the project to help them become more successful and better students. Students who create these projects use methods that helped them learn and help other students benefitas well. Teachers help students learn but do not resonate with them fully as students could help each otherthrough personal experiences with this project. For example a student does the project based on his hobby of fishing, he does an in depthprocess of research and discovers about the pollution of the Chesapeake bay. He then based his project of pollution and global warming which in the end helps him be prepared and in tunefor his environmental science class next year. If teachers created these projects the students wouldnt learn as much as projects made by students as they know what is beneficial for them.

The end goal of the project is for students to maintain the habit of learning. This is achieved through student based projects and resulting in more time for students, which leads to more outbursts of creativity, and in the end helps students learn and produce content with techniques they learned in the project. These results are produced due to students creating a project that other students can rely on and what teachers cant necessarily achieve.",0.0
e_55m4uewt,-7,Senator my name is PROPER_NAME. In my opinion i strongly think that we should not keep the Electroral College process. A process that elect the president by a vote in congress is unfair to the people. I have my reason for thinking that way. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. The people of the United States want to be able to vote for whomever they think is right to lead this country. If the people is going to have a leader i think that they shoud be able to choose that leader themselves. The electoral college is unfair to voters. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party s condidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. The people do not even know who the electors really are. Ask yourself this who picks the electors?. We all know its not the people its sometimes state conventions sometimes the sate party s central and sometimes the presidential condidates themselves. What we all asking is can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Sometimes the voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for the electors and that those electors can always defy the votes of the people. Imagine how the people feel about this The electoral college is just unfair outdated and irrational.,0.05

e_8k96tokh,-5,"I disagree with the decision for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities provide many benefits, mandatory participation should not be required.

There are several valid reasons why a onesizefitsall extracurricular policy is misguided. Not all students have the time, interest or skills for extracurriculars due to other commitments or circumstances outside of school. Some students need to work parttime jobs to help support their families financially. Others may serve as caregivers for siblings after school. Forcing these students to take on extracurricular activities would create undue stress and be counterproductive. 

In addition, extracurricular activities are not equally suitable for all students. Many involve physical activities like sports teams that may exclude students with disabilities or health issues. Introverted students may feel overwhelmed participating in activities that require extensive social interaction, like student government. Forcing participation means students may be placed in environments that undermine rather than promote their wellbeing.

Instead of mandating extracurricular involvement, a better approach is giving students choices. Students could be required to get involved in some form of engagement, but have options that consider their circumstances. For example, they could volunteer within the school or local community on their own schedule. This allows all students to get experience and learn valuable lessons outside the classroom, without imposing blanket rules that do not respect individual differences. 

Overall, while extracurricular activities offer benefits, no single policy can suit every student's needs and talents. Requiring uniform participation risks ignoring valid reasons why some students may not be suited for afterschool clubs or teams. A policy with flexibility built in shows greater respect for students' agency and wellrounded development. For these reasons, I do not agree that all students should be mandated to join extracurricular activities. Individual choice, not uniform rules, is the best approach.",1.0
e_2w3kldyf,2,"When a few days ago, you see something funny looking around Mars. You see what it looks like. Well if you are going back to the beginning of my discussion about the mysterious thing you saw on the red planet Mars, what does it look like? You may be thinking that we have an idea for it, or that this strange face was made by aliens. If I were to look at the photo of this strange figure, I think it is just a landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. The only reason that I think that this is a natural landform is because at one point, only one of my friends from NASA thought that it was just another Martian mesa. I also think it is just a natural landform because when we took the photos in 1998 and 2001 they looked different from each other.

Another reason is that only a couple of people from NASA were aware of the unusual shadows that appeared around it. During the time we took the pictures, they all looked different from each other. I also think that it could not just be a landform because we were not able to see through all the wispy clouds too.

This was not really a alien artifac, I think because all of the pictures we took in 1998 and 2001 all look different from one another. In the photo they were very blurred and could have been very dark. In 2001, they went up to the Red Planet with another spacecraft. They took pictures of the ""alien"" landforms and we could see what it was like in the first photo. The photo we took is not as blurry as we thought. We could just look at it from a certain distance because we looked in different areas of space. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

e_um1pnw9e,-3,"Academicyear projects have been a regular part of our school life. During the school year we have been asked to work on a number of such projects, thereby demonstrating what we have learned. We have set our projects to match certain milestones of learning. Even during the summer, projects are a necessity. The school system is demanding our capabilities and skills more and more and promoting independent, creative and original thinking. It is also important for us to understand and remember what we have been taught in class. It is more effective and more rewarding for us to set our own projects than for our teachers to do it for us. In fact, setting our own projects gives us the best chance of learning. It is especially important that we work together and coordinate our projects, since that is what makes us grow and develop. The freedom of thought and action that these projects give us, which would otherwise be restricted by tight regulations, gives us a platform unfamiliar to students in other countries. In the unstructured world that we live in, we have a freedom that is very much appreciated, especially when compared to schools where the students are restricted by strict regulations and confined to the textbook production line. The same type of education that is so often offered in a good school, a good curriculum that fits in with the school day is also very effective, because it helps us to learn, but also enables us to develop and grow. This explains why it has been able to show the positive impact of individualized projects, which take account of student interests, curiosity and a focus on various and diverse subjects in the learning gardens. This helps to encourage better internalization from the overall result of defaultled projects and to create continuous and profound interest in the individual student. This has been further amplified by Karen Westland Rosss study which explored the superiority of studentinspired projects as a way of learning and promoting studentinspired curriculums. It is also a wellknown fact that students drop their zeal as they race to learn the knowledge they need, looking everywhere for knowledge points to help them with their teacherdesigned projects, so they may lose interest in the detailed understanding of what they are learning, perhaps because they are more interested in getting good grades, rather than enhancing their intelligence. It is thus important for the development of skills to continue to pursue the wider range of diverse subjects that are the favorite topics of both the students and the teachers, thus upstaging the central performance index and establishing a platform for greater freedom. It is also true that following instructions and the outlined structure set by teachers set students up with various gaps in relevant learning, which cannot be avoided, because every learning cycle in a single performance area requires the judicious introduction of a calculated, numerical justification, which would prove useful for the longterm. However, a consensus has been reached by the researcher Loria, D.S.Ed., who stated that the quality of the individual assessment must be taken into account, and the overall judging of the results should include a combination of both the qualitative and the mathematicsrelated items. The arguments of the study concurred with the beliefs of the people doing the teaching, arguing that more often than not, the assessment was based on the other skills of the person studying, which often leaves a naive impression to the person indulging in the study, and argued that such an assessment is usually based on the students abilities. Generally, it is accepted that openended methods directed at students and their interests are more apt to produce positive results. The reason for this is that, as a result of the individual thinking that has been stimulated, it has been possible to introduce a conceptbased approach to the teaching of a single subject.",1.0

e_f4z9zzs5,0,"Now a days everyone wants to start driving an automobile. The question that needs to be brought up is if it is better not to drive and take public transportation or just be carfree all together. Car polution is a bad problem in America. It doesnt help with the enviroment and is not good for people to drive. Car polution is a negative thing which is why many cities like VAUBAN,GERMANY are doing their part. Many Americans would like to stop car usage too but its not so easy because everybody depends on them to move around to work. It would be really nice to carfree places.

I believe all Americans should be aware of the amount of car polution that goes on in their country, and take precautions to it. If every American could walk or car pool instead then it would be a better world. Not just Americans, but everyone should take precautions in what they can do that will effect the nature, and environment. I would be very pleased if Americans would be able to do this as its not that hard. A lot of people would be able to help. If America had a car polution free day everyone would want in it and not even drive. It would be nice for the world to not have to worry about it anymore. If people can stop it there for a whole day it would be nice for a change to see people outside playing basketball,running, or anything not in a car, or truck. This would also help the air not be poisoned as much.

The only people that can stop polution is the one's that get in there vehicles everyday. But there are still thousands and hundreds more people that dont like driving,and they do other fun activities out of their cars and would be pleased if Americans took precautions. They may start this new trend or some may want it. I know I would want to do this. I know there would be some people who dont think they need and need something on their phones. That would be okay to still to that. I still would want for Americans to carpolution free one whole day.

If this happens its great I'm not gonna go on with it. If Americans dont do it,then its sad because i thought everyone would care about what they do for themselve's and their families, but i guess some dont.

In conclusion,I hope everyone takes a stand in car pooling and walking more. I think we need to do it. And its also good if we have a few more days where we have to car poilution free for one or for a few days in a season and not one for sure to not be driven by everyone. But all in the end i hope it happens so I am going to stand for whats good for our enviornment.",1.0
e_e4cclk30,5,"The author states that this technology is called a Facial Action Coding System. This piece of technology could be used in good ways, but in bad ways.

One reason why this is good is for court cases, such as what happened to Al Gore. In court cases, there will be a lot of arguments and arguments against this tech. There is also the issue of people who might not want this to be brought up, and what if people are thinking it is ok to see them and they are scared. The article goes on to say that some people might be scared about this. Also, this can also cause them to get scared and it could possibly have something bad go wrong with it. Although the technology may not seem to want to try to use this sytem they might end up being messed up.

Although the article states that ""The Facial Action Coding System enables the computer to identify human emotions. This technology has gotten alot of attention. The article says that people who are watching the videos could get their attention taken. If this technology is used people will see if they are happy, sad, confused, and any other emotions people have. This could come in handy or handy at times. People would also think that this is an amazing way to check peoples emotions or feelings, as it explains on the article.

Although people would say that technology is good for this, it can also be used for bad things. One reason would be for a law suit or something of that sort. In the article it says that it can read a person's emotions, if they are sad or angry or happy. The article states that the facial expressions of people can reveal so much about the science of emotions. When this technology is being developed more and more people will get used to it, so it could be useful in the real world.

Another reason why this is bad, is that they can find out about people's emotions, and tell if they feel sad, happy, mad, scared, etc. The article talks about how this technology teaches us new things and helps us in the future when it comes to school. It claims that when you ask a teenager if they are lying to you they would like to try to hid it, but they also may be able to help you out, since we know that the older people that are happy are going to want to know too. If the old people are still alive, it would not be good for them to do something like this.

The last reason is becuase you could modify the way a lesson is being taught. This will help people in schools learn how to communicate with their teachers or their peers and help them get a better job on there assignments. This could also help tutor the younger people who are struggling in school, or maybe they are just bored in class. The techonology could be the cause of people being angry or sad. As long as the teacher knows what their students are feeling, the technology could read their facial expressions in the classroom.

Although this tech can be useful for people who would like to try this out on their own,. For this to work and it would be a waste of time, they would have to pay more attention to what is happening in the classroom. I think that if this technology was put into action and made more people want to learn it, then maybe it is worth the effort to see how this works. This technology isn't needed to be there in labs or used in movies. We could try this with people and see what kind of emotion they have based on the how the student is feeling..

This technology could also be used to detect emotions, and this could help in court cases, as stated in the article. This technology is very useful when it comes to advangates, but it will most likely lead to more problems than it could solve. We should not be the only ones to use this technology in this generation, however, this type of technolgy will be very helpful in the future and useful in all kinds of situations.

Even though this is good, there are some down sides to this. First of all, people who are not happy with this technology could try to change the way they act, like in this article it says that in paragraph 7 they could be able to look at their feelings and use them as they like. Second, they may not have good feelings towards this tech, Also, this will help to see how people are feeling, and to try to fix them. If this technology does become obsolete, then let it be out there on peoples computers for a while, so we could see their reactions and if they are sad as well. That would help people in need who are happy and not lieing. This technology would be usless in many ways.

This is why I think that this piece of technology would be a good idea for court cases, and for other things as well. People who would have good opinions of the technology and what goes on with it should do the same. If I have to make this nutreal I will give my opinion on the idea of implementing this technoloy in schools.",0.7

I know there is risk, but it is worth it.You can have fun, and you feel good in your heart, all of which are just to help people in need.I thank myself for their opposition, which made me know more people in other countries and their needs.I do believe that it is worth becoming a sea cowboy.Who knows maybe you will be the next.

e_9dduhi1j,1,"Dear State Senator,

Here are my thoughts on the US presidential electoral process. I think that the Electoral College is fundamentally flawed. The system of winner takes all votes encourages candidates to focus all their efforts on appealing to the minority of voters in a few ""battleground"" states, largely ignoring the majority of the country. This is clearly not a fair system. Surely, it would be better to have a system where the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected president, as is the case for the other officers of government.

But hold on, I hear you say. What about the concerns that have been raised about this country being divided into blue states and red states, with the coasts favoring one party and the center of the country another, and neither side having an interest in reaching out to the other? This phenomenon, of course, would be amplified were the presidency to be decided by a simple majority of popular votes.

The answer to this concern, I believe, can be found in a system not unlike the current one, were the country divided into a number of regions and the winner of the presidential election is the candidate who wins the most regions, each region being awarded a number of electoral votes in proportion to its size  in the current system, this would likely mean that the winner of the popular vote would also be the winner of the most electoral votes. This system would encourage candidates to appeal to as many voters as possible in as many regions as possible, while the system of awarding electoral votes in proportion to a region's size would prevent a tsunami of votes in a few populous states from deciding the election.

I hope you will consider my thoughts on this matter and thank you for your time.",1.0

e_oc7cz5qu,-1,"Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. There are many reasons why using your phone is dangerous for drivers. Reasons include distracted driving, accidents involving other vehicles, wrecks or collisions, death of self or others involved in the accident, fines from law enforcement.

Cell phone usage results in 1.6 million car crashes per year. The National Safety Council reported that cellphone use while driving leads to 1 out of every 4 motor vehicle crash deaths. This equates to more than 390,000 injuries annually due to people being on their devices while driving. It also states that texting while driving increases risk by six times as likely. In fact, sending one single message can cause a person to take hisher eyes off the road long enough to cover three football fields. These facts prove how dangerous it is to operate any type of motorized vehicle with your hands occupied holding onto a device such as a smart phone. Studies show that a lot of teenagers die each day because they decide to pick up there device instead of paying attention to the road. Driving requires all your attention at all times but when you're busy trying to multitask between talking on the phone and driving then it puts everyone else around them in danger. When your focus isn't solely on the road, you could potentially injure someone else in another vehicle who may have had no control over what happened. That's something nobody wants on their conscience nor do they want to face lawsuits, fees, or jail time.

In conclusion, drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle. People will get hurt, lives will be lost, money will be spent. And worst of all, it is completely avoidable just by making simple decisions. You have to think about yourself, friends, family members, strangers, and even pets that might cross the street while someone is driving.",0.9
e_9en5yy1l,5,"The Facial Action Coding System, FACS for short, is a new technology that reads the emotional expressions of people. This tool can be very useful in many ways to help our society. It's use could potentially change how we teach and learn in schools, work places, or at home. The idea behind this computer system is based off of the way humans communicate with each other through facial expression. We all have done it before without even knowing it. For example, if your friend was upset you would ask them whats wrong then try to make them feel better because they look sad. That is basically exactly what this new program does but more effective. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author tells us about all kinds of things this program could do such as read paintings like da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and tell her emotions. They also say it could be used on students in classrooms to see when they are bored so the teacher knows when to stop talking and explain something else. Lastly, they mention how it could detect fake smiles which I think is really cool.

In paragraph 5, the author explains how the FACS could possibly change the education world by reading the expressions of kids while they are working on assignments. If a student gets confused then the software will know that they need some kind of assistance. When this happens it will alert someone who can help the kid out. Many teachers give their students worksheets and assign homework on topics that might not interest the child, therefore making them disinterested in learning. When this happens the student doesn't pay attention and ends up just copying answers from a friends paper or searching Google for the answer. According to Dr Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confuse or bored."" He continues to elaborate, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By doing this, the school environment becomes much less boring and children actually start caring about their grades and education.

In paragraph six, Professor Thomas Huang states how the computer can identify genuine versus forced smile. ""If you're smiling but feeling saddened on the inside, the software could recognize that,"" he says. ""Meanwhile, if you force a smile, the muscles in your face will indicate the difference."" While this may sound creepy, it helps keep others safe too. Imagine going into public restroom to find the most disgusting thing you ever seen. Your body starts reacting negatively and goes into shock mode. You want to let somebody know immediately so they don't go in there after you. What are you supposed to do? Yell, scream, call for someone to come down to the bathroom ASAP? Well now, you wouldn't have to do any of those things anymore thanks to the FACS! Once another person walks past you, they will notice your reaction and report back to whoever needs to hear the information.

This new device called FACS has many uses in life. In the text, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it gives examples of why this tool should become apart of everyday life. There are countless number of scenarios where this program could save lives or prevent situations from happening. From helping people in the school setting to keeping everyone safe in case of emergency, these machines play a big role in todays society.",0.9
e_l08i4ks2,2,"Have you ever heard about the face on Mars? A lot of people have. NASA sent the Viking one up into space to try and capture pictures of mars. The Viking was taking pictures when it noticed a shadowy figure. Can you guess what that figure is? Conspiracy theorists have their own vision of what it was made by, but NASA's scientists had the facts about it!

In paragraph two it says, ""The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise. The conspiracy theorists think that the face was made by Aliens. They also think that the face was really think that it was made by Aliens, and that NASA knows it was, but they just do not want to reveal it. Conspiracy theorists think it's Bona Fide, and that it's evidence of life on Mars. This all shows that the conspiracy theorists have different points of view than the NASA scientists do.

In paragraph seven it says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting then the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" When scientists put the image out online not everyone was satisfied with what the scientists said. Conspiracy theorists still think that it was made by Aliens. This shows that the scientists at NASA have facts and that the conspiracy theorists have only a picture.

In paragraph eleven Garvin says, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects in this picture like aiplanes on the ground or Egytianstyle pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" In paragraph twelve it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Garvin added, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This shows that NASA thinks that the face was just a natural landd form. Everyone else thinks that it was made by Aliens.

In paragraph eight it says that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Now everyone is saying, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" They all think now possibly they were made by Aliens. This shows that we may have made a serious mistake in how the face was made. The face could've been made by both natural forming or by aliens.

In conclusion, the face could have been made by Aliens and we just do not know it. We could have been wrong for all we know! So we need to think to not doubt ourselves. We all need to think, was the face really made by aliens? It could've been! We need to learn to work together on our theories not against each other.",0.0

e_4m0gp6b1,-7,Teen Driving We can remember the teams were driving driving their cell phones which could the that they it be such a great tool. Most teenagers don t find the real risk of texting while driving as these texting and driving facts for teenagers can appear. Distracted driving is the hotbutton subject matter particularly when it comes to the younger generations. We get attached to our cell phone while behind this machine but adolescent drivers are the worst offenders. This is a scary idea as driving driving is dangerous and harmful on its own. However add that with the ignorance of the teenage driver and we are talking about a real dangerous combination. To start off even though the risk of texting while driving are welldocumented that has done very little to stop adolescent drivers from doing so. Some people question why there are so many commercials about texting and driving. That is one of these numerous reasons. teenagers and even adults don t consider how dangerous it actually is. The fact of the matter is that texting while driving takes the persons away from the road severely increasing the chances of a crash. Moreover teenagers that text while driving are proven to be out of this way within 10 of their overall driving period as their thoughts are off the road and they aren t paying attention to the direction of their vehicle. secondly the fact that teen drivers are usually the least skilled motorist on the road may make the information about texting while driving that much more difficult to tell considering that most teens think that they are very skilled at what they are doing. some states have attempted to enforce that texting while driving was bad among teens and adolescent drivers by establishing a particular band against the practice. Some states have still yet to give such a cell phone ban for inexperienced drivers. According to Teensafeblog 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. Teen drivers are four times more likely than adults to get into car accidents while texting or talking on the cell phone. this shows how connected and attached we are to our cell phones no matter where we are at the risk that can take place. Some teams have even put on themselves that texting at a stoplight is okay because you are not moving and no one can be in danger. This is not true. You need to have just as much attention on the road when at a stop light as if you re on the road moving. you need to be cautious of your surroundings and who is around you at all times even when halted at a stoplight.,0.05
e_9bhjj50p,4,"I am against the idea of designing completely driverless cars. For one, if an accident were to happen, who would be held responsible? If everyone was driving autonomously, there would be nobody to blame. While this might seem like an ideal situation in some ways, such as not having to pull over on the side of the road during long trips, the potential for accidents is a major concern. I believe that having a human driver would be necessary, especially in busy areas and work zones where human skills are required.

Despite this, the advancements in sensors and computer technology are making it increasingly possible for cars to handle more and more driving tasks on their own. Google, for example, has developed selfdriving cars that use laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of their surroundings. These cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human intervention. BMW has also developed a Traffic Jam Assistant that can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary.

Some manufacturers hope to bring fun to driving by incorporating entertainment and informational systems. These displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over, making them a safety feature. However, presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that a human driver is in control at all times, and it is illegal to test computerdriven cars in most states. New laws will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident.

Despite the challenges, automakers are continuing to work on developing driverless cars. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time, and Nissan plans to have driverless cars by 2020. While I acknowledge the potential benefits of driverless cars, I believe that having a human driver would be necessary for the foreseeable future to ensure safety and accountability on the roads.",0.9

e_af4zbudw,3,"Luke bomberger had an interesting story to tell about his adventures on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy fresh out of high school working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men onboard played all kinds of games like Baseball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

e_jjfsqdx6,4,"Have you ever had a dream about a car driving itself while you just layed back and relaxed? So have many other people. Companies have been working on developing a self driving car. There have been hopes and stories about this since as early as the 1950's, but now we have the technology to actually do this wonderful thing.

At the beginning of this experimentation for the self driving car, lots of people trying to get it to work were using ""smart"" roads. Roads that had electrical cables or magnets in it, but the cost for ""smart"" roads would not be worth it. ""Smart"" cars though are cheaper than fixing and replacing all of the roads in the world. ""Smart"" cars had many sensors, video cameras, and a GPS receiver. They have a sensor on top of the car that is constantly making a threedimentional model of the cars surrounding so the car can react to what is going on around it.

The Google ""smart"" cars have been in progress since the year 2009. Their cars have driven a bit over half a million miles, and the cars have yet to get into an accident. So by logical conclusion, the ""smart"" cars reduce the accidents that happen or at least reduce the frequency. Then cars are still not fully done. Yet some places are allowing companies to test the cars out on open roads, such as: California, Florida, District of Columbia, and Nevada. Sadly these cars are not fully complete so some still need the assistance of humans when it comes to accidents or moving to avoid the work zones.

""Smart"" cars are very useful and have alot of wonderful benifits to them. These cars will very much likely use less fuel than the average car or taxi. They are less pron to get into accidents than human driven cars. They will take a bit more supplies to make these cars be able to do everything the need to be able to do to handle the real roads, but with all the money saved on fuel and all the money saved on not having as many accidents, it will all be worth it.

These ""smart"" cars are revolutionary and are changing the world, and as science continues to change and evolve each day, I'm sure we will soon aceive the goal of a car that con completely drive on its own with no human help. They take less gas and reduce the number of accidents. Who can complain with that.",0.0

e_puh6yo4j,6,"In the article ""The challenge of exploring venus"", Almost 4,000 peopl have died from there. In paragraph 2 in paragraph 4 in line two it states that ""Venus is the second planet to the sun"". That is a dangerous place and has been trying to keep humans living in that planet as for the past couple of hundred years.

I am going to tell you why it's dangerous to go to venus.

One of the reasons why it's bad is because in paragraph 3 sentence 4 it says that venus wasn't supposed to be like that at one point in time. It's one of the best things to get to venus. For example if you wanted to see the planet you would need to find out what it is despite the dangers that it may cause. The author is in paragraph four it states ""It may well be the most earth like planet in the solar system because of its proximity to us.""

The second reason why Venus is dangerous is because no spacecraft has made a eveidence to land on its surface and not have been in space in more than three decades. For example in paragraph 2 sentence 3 it says a spacecraft has never landed on venus in three decades. This proves that its dangerous is because they didn't know of how long they could be there and for how close they are to their other objects.

A reason why Venus is dangerous is because the author is saying that even though it's dangerous people will still believe in what they are doing and wanting to go to venus. The author said ""Venus is the clossest planet to earth in terms of density and size"". Another reason why Venus is dangerous is because human can't travel on the planet itself. Also it states in paragraph 4 that ""The challange of exploring Venus"" proves that even with its dangers and doubts humans would be curious enough to want to go and see what's on venus.

This are the reasons why venus is dangerous to humans and that's the main reason why it might not be safe in the future.",0.7
e_mkri6bhf,-6,"Louisiana Pacific System. LP has decided to close its Ketchikan Pulp Mill following a series of failed negotiations with the Clinton Administration. The move comes from years of controversy surrounding the technology of the that that have made were both environmentally destructive and hazardous to public life. The Ketchikan Pulp Mill which has been in operation since the 1950s has been a source of controversy for many years. As one of the state s largest pulp and paper mills it has been accused of polluting the environment and endangering the health of local residents. In these years the company has come under many scrutiny from the Clinton system which has been used for a and and a greater opportunity for our health. Despite repeated negotiations between the two sides however no agreement has been reached leading LP to make the decision to close the mill. Our decision to close the Ketchikan Pulp Mill was not an easy one but we believe it is the best course of action for both the company and the community said LP CEO Brad Southern in a statement to the press. We have been engaged in good faith negotiations and the the it for all time now, but we have been able to to make an agreement that meets the reasons of the sides. The closure of the Ketchikan Pulp Mill is expected to have a significant impact on the local economy with hundreds of jobs being lost as a result. The company has pledged to work with local officials and community leaders to minimize the impact of the closure and to help affected workers find new employment opportunities. Many environmental and public health advocates have hailed the decision to close the mill as a victory for their cause arguing that LP s practices had posed a significant threat to the health and well being of local residents. LP s decision to close the Ketchikan Pulp Mill is a victory for all those who have been fighting for greater protections for the environment and public health said environmental activist Jane Doe in a statement to the press. For too long this company has been allowed to operate with complete disregard for the impact it was having on the local community. We are glad to see that they have finally been held accountable. Others however have expressed concern about the impact that the closure of the mill will have on the local economy arguing that the loss of so many jobs will have a ripple effect that will be felt throughout the community. This is a good idea for the people of Ketchikan who have been on the mill for a new, and economic stability, the author states John Smith. While we certainly share the concerns of those who have been fighting for greater environmental protections we also recognize that this closure will have a significant impact on our community and we will be working hard to mitigate the effects as much as possible. Despite the controversy surrounding LP' practices the company has pledged to continue operating in other things in the state. and need to work with other officials and community leaders to ensure that their operations are conducted in a good and responsible manner.

e_6luizrcx,4,"In the modern world, our technology is advancing rapidly, pushing the boundaries of what we once thought was possible. One of the most talked about developments in recent years has been the concept of driverless cars. In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author explores both the positive and negative aspects of this innovation. As I review the article, I find myself in support of the idea of driverless cars and all that it will offer to our society.

The author brings up the issue of restrictive laws that prevent some states from conducting testing on these cars. However, I believe that car manufacturers can overcome this obstacle by conducting testing in states where it is legal. Once they have proven the safety and efficiency of driverless cars, these restrictive laws should be lifted, paving the way for this groundbreaking technology to be implemented nationwide.

A common concern among people is the issue of liability in the event of a car accident caused by a driverless car. The article raises the question, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?"" 9. In my opinion, the manufacturer should be held accountable as they are the ones who designed and produced the car. It is their responsibility to ensure the safety of their product, and any financial burdens should fall on them, not innocent drivers. This eliminates any concerns about liability for individuals and allows them to comfortably embrace the use of driverless cars.

Another significant advantage of driverless cars is the significant reduction in fuel consumption. As the article states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"" 1. This reduction in fuel usage would greatly benefit the environment, as well as the wallets of consumers who would save money on gas. Additionally, driverless cars would greatly improve safety on the roads, as stated by BMW, ""Safety is a big concern"" 8. With autonomous cars, the number of accidents and fatalities on the road would drastically decrease, saving countless lives.

Many automakers are already working towards developing new safety technologies and introducing driverless cars to the market. Tesla, for example, plans to release a car that can operate on autopilot for 90% of the time this year 10. This is a significant step towards a future where autonomous cars will dominate the roads. Other manufacturers, including MercedesBenz, Audi, and Nissan, have set a goal to have selfdriving cars by 2020 10. This rapid development in the automobile industry shows the potential for driverless cars to become a common mode of transportation in the near future.

In conclusion, while there may be some challenges to overcome, the benefits of driverless cars are undeniable. These cars have the potential to greatly improve safety, reduce fuel consumption, and revolutionize the way we travel. As more and more automakers join the race to perfect these vehicles, it is only a matter of time before driverless cars become a widespread reality. Therefore, I fully support the development and implementation of autonomous cars for the betterment of our society.",1.0

They said that they might have found something, like an old burial ground. Then on January 8, 2001, Malin took a second look at it. He said that it was just a ""Butte or mesa"" like the rock formations of the mid west from there it made a big discussion and was all over the media. NASA would never make these kind of discoveries.

I do think that NASA made a mistake with making the claim about the shadow of alien heads. The main evidence to prove the statement. Is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or meal a lava donm. There isn't any ""faces"" there is not a chance at any sign of a alien."" This statement is to prove that it really and truly was just a land form. That there is no sign at all anywere to say that their was indeed alien activity. NASA did not have the right to blame space aliens of this act becausw that is not there job. They didn't want to have to deal with that when its already to much to handle with there first planet on Mars.

I would love to see how doing something like this would effect effect the school. It's going to be a good chance to see what he school can benefit from this. The school would definitely change because there are more students participating in things like the schools tennis team, student council, or a book reading group. Overall this would have some positive effects like more students joining more activities, but sooner or later this might get out of hand. What I mean is that id people wantto join a certain group they really like they might not be able because there isnt enough room. This might not be a good out look on the school id students cant join their favorite activity.

If you did make these changes it could make the average C student pull their grade up to a B average depending on wether or not that student participates in school Activities  Sports etc. This makes the overall school report card better than C average and most students' parents would be proud. Causing the school's ratings to shoot through the roof.

It could also make the average students' grades drop drastically causing a serious problem and parents would become very upset. Also including the school report card to drop and have the side effect of a minor weight problem with in the school. Inclining child hood obesity witch is a world wide problem in today's

I am confused to the reason on why you would choose to change the school's policy on admisoion into spores.

e_72ze85ir,-2,"The scientific method allows scientists to study various phenomena by testing their assumptions built from observations of the surrounding world. As a result of exploring and attempting to explain the world, a scientific method process used by researchers was formed. It includes such steps as exploration through observation and questioning and testing hypotheses and predictions and their verification through experiments or additional observations. Despite the benefit and clarity of the scientific method, readers should still critically evaluate the information presented in articles.
Scientific articles often address current problems of concern to society. For instance, an article serving as a secondary source and presented in The Economist describes a study testing measures for HIV prevention among young African women G.C.. The original study was published by Baird et al. in the scientific journal The Lancet. In this work, the use of the scientific method is clearly traced. The authors observed that African women are forced to date and marry older men to ensure their own wellbeing, but such relationships contribute to the spread of HIV Baird et al. 1320. The researchers hypothesized that providing additional financial assistance to young women would change their lives and not be forcing them to marry older men. Baird et al. conducted a randomized cluster trial to test their hypothesis. They held an experiment providing an additional income to a group of unmarried African women. As a result, the hypothesis was confirmed  financial independence reduced the incidence of HIV.
When critically evaluating an article, it is worth noting that it has many advantages that testify to its reliability.

e_ehh32f2p,-2,"Introduction
The fashion industry, known for its fastpaced production cycles and relentless pursuit of innovation, has long been associated with environmental degradation and social inequality. However, in recent years, the concept of sustainability has gained significant traction, aiming to tackle these pervasive issues. This essay aims to explore how the concept of sustainability impacts the fashion industry and its relationship to social inequality within the sector. By examining various aspects, from supply chain practices to consumer behavior, we can shed light on the potential for sustainable fashion to address social inequalities.
Body
1. Sustainable Supply Chains and Labor Practices:
One significant area in which sustainability influences the fashion industry is through the cultivation of sustainable supply chains and labor practices. Often, fashion production relies heavily on lowcost labor, leading to exploitative working conditions and a lack of job security, predominantly in developing countries. The concept of sustainability encourages fair trade, worker protections, and livable wages, aiming to reduce social inequalities. Brands that adhere to these principles enhance their reputation among socially conscious consumers, further promoting sustainability.
2. Ethical Sourcing and Material Choices:
The fashion industry's overreliance on nonrenewable resources and environmentally harmful practices contributes notably to ecological degradation and social inequality. Sustainable fashion seeks to address this disparity through ethical sourcing and material choices. By reducing the industry's carbon footprint and embracing renewable materials, social inequalities related to resource extraction and environmental degradation can be minimized. By promoting the use of recycled materials, organic fabrics, and innovative ecofriendly technologies, sustainable fashion can mitigate the industry's adverse impact on marginalized communities.
3. Ethical Marketing and Consumer Education:
In the context of social inequality in the fashion industry, the role of consumers cannot be undermined. Sustainable fashion encourages informed consumer choices and ethical marketing practices, which highlight the social implications of clothing production. By providing consumers with transparent information about a brand's sustainability efforts, consumers are empowered to make conscious purchasing decisions and demand accountability from companies. This process can foster social equality by redirecting profits and supporting brands that prioritize fair wages and working conditions, thus promoting social inclusivity within the industry.
4. Slow Fashion and Circular Economy:
The fashion industry's fastpaced nature perpetuates a cycle of overconsumption and disposability, negatively impacting both the environment and social equality. Slow fashion, an integral component of sustainability, promotes the production of highquality, durable garments, reducing the frequency of purchases and subsequent waste. By embracing circular economy principles, where clothes are designed for longevity and recyclability, the industry can minimize social inequalities stemming from the production of cheap, disposable garments, while also reducing environmental harm.
Conclusion
The concept of sustainability serves as a transformative force within the fashion industry, impacting both environmental practices and social inequality. By addressing issues such as fair labor practices, ethical sourcing, informed consumer choices, and a shift towards slow fashion and circular economy principles, the industry has the potential to mitigate its negative impact on marginalized communities and restore balance. Nevertheless, substantial efforts are still required to ensure widespread adoption of sustainable practices and to dismantle the structures contributing to social inequalities within the fashion industry. As consumers become more conscious and brands prioritize sustainability, the scope for positive change and the reduction of social inequality within the industry grows.",1.0

Selfdriving cars are the future of transportation. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author discusses the idea of driverless cars, the pros and cons of having them, and how they will affect the future of transportation.

Driverless cars are the future of transportation. They are selfdriving cars that can drive themselves. They are safer than regular cars, they are more efficient, and they are more cost efficient. Driverless cars are the next big thing.

Driverless cars are safer than regular cars. They are safer because they can detect and avoid accidents. The article states that, ""The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Driverless cars are safer because they are more aware of their surroundings. They can avoid accidents by noticing when a human driver is not paying attention.

Driverless cars are more efficient than regular cars. They are more efficient because they use half the fuel of a taxi and can carry more passengers than a taxi. The article states that, ""The car uses half the fuel of today's taxis and is intended to seat nine passengers."" Driverless cars are more efficient because they can carry more passengers than a taxi, and they use half the fuel.

Driverless cars are more cost efficient than regular cars. They are more cost efficient because they do not need human drivers. The article states that, ""Their sensors are more advanced than the sensors in today's cars."" The sensors in driverless cars can detect when a human driver needs to take over.

Driverless cars are the future of transportation. They are safer, more efficient, and more cost efficient. They are the next big thing in the world of transportation. Driverless cars will change the way we drive. They will change the way the world drives.",1.0

Do you want to see people suffering in famine? Hopefully, you will too! Trust me. I agree with taking part in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

When you participate in this program, it helps you think of the people in need, and how they are really grateful for you help. You help by doing this by donating money to the Red Star Foundation, which is a great cause. You will have to give the people who are affraired with supplies that they need and you will also help them by collecting canned food.

Not only does it help others but it also gives you a great oppertunity to see and tour many places that you never have seen before! It teaches you to take care of horses and don't over seas! It is also fun because you can meet and get to know people in need! Having fun and making friends with the animals you travel to see are all fun. You can also help others who needed it. For instance, in the United States we have some people who are too brave to travel and go on trips to the places they were going to help.",0.7

In previous years 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. many thing that people who dont own a car they can not get around. it would be very diffucult to do the things you want to do! many people have cars for different reasons people have cars to get them back to and from work and alot of other reasons. without cars doing many things would be very hard to do. alot of problems come with having a car you have to make sure its in the right make sure all the parts are good fix them if they need fixing and take to it when it needs to be done. cars come from many places all over the world thers car part that come from all over the world and you got to replace the carb sometimes when there is a problem! in the enviorment some people say cars are bad because of the pollution they be putting in the air and that is true but without a car nothing is possible well i wouldnt say possible but it would be very hard to get around.,0.4172484805729397
e_bibdqgqa,-7,"Coronavirus disease is a rapidly growing worldwide pandemic due to severe pulmonary and syndrome coronavirus 2 henceforth increased pessimism and high loss of lives. It was first discovered in Wuhan China in a cluster of pneumonia patients with acute respiratory illness. The pandemic presents an unrivaled challenge to public healthcare and food systems Alcendor 2020. As governments continue to curb the scourge through policies, trade measures and confinement measures it has crippled economy. Beyond impacting public health, the pandemic has significant effects on many other factors. Disparities in knowledge attitudes and and KAPs often exist during COVID. White people are perceived to likely have high knowledge and confidence associated with a high level of education and income compared to their nonwhite counterparts who were likely to have a low level of education and attitude but are viewed as high practice responders Alcendor 2020. Race sex education income health insurance status and political views are all associated with KAPs. Hispanic and African Americans have a higher infection rate and the number of deaths despite being minority races. AfricanAmericans had many deaths in Chicago and Louisiana despite being a minority consisting of roughly a third of the population. These undermine the social determinants in health socioeconomic disparities and prevalent racial disparities in health outcomings in the USA. In NEW YORK 34 of COVIDrelated deaths were Hispanics who consist of almost a third of the population Alobuia et al. 2020. Concerning knowledge of COVID a higher percentage of white people had a slightly higher knowledge than Hispanics or AfricanAmericans who scored lower in a study done by the Kaiser Family Foundation KFF Coronavirus poll conducted between 11 and 15 march 2020 on people living in the USA. Its therefore easy to say a majority of White people had exposure to information on COVID compared to their Hispanic and AfricanAmerican counterparts. The sociodemographical racial disparities are evident as areas with a high population of Hispanics and AfricanAmericans lacked the correct knowledge on the COVID virus. Univariate analysis shows that AfricanAmericans and Hispanics have a higher attitude towards COVID positive or negative than the White race. These can be highly attributed to the higher number of white people with higher health insurance than other races in the US. Similarly income highly affects attitude and those with high income annually were fewer attitudes than smallincome earners Alobuia et al. 2020. Higher levels of education and political stands are some of the major factors leading to a higher attitude among Whites than other races. Hispanic and AfricanAmericans have a higher practice rate than Whites in the US. These can be attributed to exposure to the effects of the virus and not knowledge of the virus. The lack of knowledge and the are often in thes Alobuia and3. 2020. COVID has affected a lot of social norms and cultural practices among minority races more than whites hence the higher number of practices among them. In conclusion despite having lower knowledge and more negative experiences minority races are likely to engage in safe practices to minimize the spread and infection of COVID. Many measures have been put in place to minimize the spread of COVID. These directives may reduce the spread but having the correct knowledge and a positive attitude can affect how we relate to COVID. It also leads to more empowerment and inclusivity in decisionmaking among minorities. Racial disparities in KAP exist globally. A racial and financial divergence exists in the degrees of KAPs connected with COVID19. More work is expected to distinguish instructive apparatuses customized to explicit racial and socioeconomic groups.",0.05
e_c3mwvg1i,3,"Do you thnk if participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is worthy?

My friend would say: ""yes"" because you will be able to see and travel to incredible lands and animals. Also, helping others all around the globe can lead your country to good and more loving. I think if you decide to play the role can improve your life.

First of all, you could get more expericence for what the real world is allabout just like in the passage,""It was 1945 in the Pacific War.""You get more knowledge about travel,seeing different places,aniamls too because sometimes you ride on a ship a lot. Helping to care for the aniamls too is a good way to learn about their life and needs,like feeding and water them constantly for their good and your good too.

Second of ale,people want you to help others because thats what they think is right just like in the passage, ""By joining the Seagoing Cowboys program i also toured a lot of incredible and awesome countries in the world you can't really tour everyday. But if your an animal person and loves animals than it can also you have more skills to raise and take care for them while you go on an incredible road trip or visit. For example ,as shown in the passage it said,""he had the side benefit of widening his knowledge of the world"". As seen there, the boy went to some places around the world and got more experianced on traveling and seeing the world all while he was playing that role. As I mentioned earlier,""Taking that ride gave me an advantage on exploring and seeing the whole world.""

Then,when you reseach for what you want to work you will be able to find out the benefits you get on that specific job. Doing the job is a wonderful oppurtumaty too and there is no turning back there. You could also become famous as people will remember how you went and did it and still be famous about it today therefor many jobs are more than just doing work,you are a role model for thnking your way into an amazing job.

But also, you want to make it all worth while on a long ride because there is not always work and playing work because sometimes you have to see if anything dangerous is around before getting start as the ocean it is rough for humans that are traveling the sea.""It is a lonesomes journey on seeing the whole world. Not everyday you get asked that can you make into it .""""That's the hard for me is that you can work with whats infront of you. It shows your skill,taking those risk and that you care. Theres is no quiting. It is an expeacible world after all so you might end up travelling even more because that can happen. If you do play that role. "" I bet you that the people who played the job as a role didn't go back, they just kept making more friends and more experiences on their trips. So its up to you to make that decision too about choosing to play in such roles and if it is worth it or not.""If the person played the role and came back saying to you"" yes the travel helped change all my life there is no more saying no's or quiting. When those types of roles change are life, you know it is worth playing a role in that it's the type of job your parents or a close uncle want to you to follow into. It will also make sure their that when you are making these desciions if it should be done or shouldnt"" because even in this day and age the world can change and you get a chance in life to decide what you can do to do right thing there are alot of hard and bad decisions but there are easy and good decisions too and if you choose wrong, you won't end into doing right.",1.0
e_bujb5z77,3,"Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program was a thrilling experience. As a cowboy who was used to riding horses, I never imagined I'd be riding the waves on a ship one day. But when I joined the program, I was amazed at the opportunities it presented.

For one, I got to visit so many different places. From the coasts of America to the islands of Japan, I saw parts of the world I never thought I'd see. And getting to experience the local culture in each place was just as amazing. I'll never forget the warm welcome we received in Hawaii, or the delicious food we tried in Spain.

But it wasn't just about the travel. The work we did as cowboys was important. We helped to provide food to people who needed it, and that was a great feeling. It was like we were making a difference in the world, and I'm proud to have been a part of that.

So if you're thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, I say go for it! You'll get to see the world, experience different cultures, and do important work. It's an adventure you'll never forget. And who knows, maybe you'll even get to ride a horse on a ship someday.",1.0
e_98nw3x9m,6,"The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim. The author uses support mainly focused on the idea in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6.

In paragraph 4, the author said that Venus is theorized to once be covered in water, able to provide homes for all sorts of little organisms. They also say that Venus might have been the ""most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" They compared it to Earth even more because of how it has a rocky surface and has similar valleys, mountains, and craters. The author spent time comparing Venus to Earth's surface and features for remote resembalance.

Later, in paragraph 5, the author mentions how NASA The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has ""one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's ""twin"". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimplike vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and ""avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way."" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.

Moreover, the author gives reasoning that ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannnot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Researchers could also not be able to take any samples of anything from Venus from a distance if NASA were to proceed with the blimplike plan, meaning that the researchers would have no other choice but to go down onto Venus to take samples, even though it's dangerous.

The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons. They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans. The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA. This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",0.0
e_octdcu9w,-1,"Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extra curricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other prioritieswhether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.

There is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they dont have enough time already and if forced to join a club that only meets once a week for an hour that just cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sports that are very time consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time consuming part of every child'slife is family, spending time with grand parents or even just having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.

A huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.

To close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club dont want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it just makes everything worse. Also there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.

Kids shouldnt be required to be in an extra curricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many different things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",0.0

In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", the author talks alot about evidence relating to whether there are alien civilazations or not on mars. The Face On Mars is evidence against there being aliens because it is just a mesa formed naturally by landforms.

Landforms form everyday around mars. The formation of the landform could be because aliens formed it, but thats not very logical reasoning becuase there is alot more natural landforms than there are alien landforrm forms around the planet mars today.

There is a huge chance theres just natural forms around the mars planet today that are formed naturally by landforms around mars today becuase ther are landforms everywhere on earth that are natural formed landforms.",1.0
e_3qfroou4,2,"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counterarguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counterargument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counterargument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution.",0.0

e_uve5xnu8,-1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe you should allow all of the students in our school, to use their cell phones during lunch other free times, during the school schedule. It would be extremely beneficial to us. For example there are many students in the school who break the rules break by using it during class, which distracts them from what the teacher is instructing the class or lecture they are trying to give. At the same time the student is risking the confiscation of their cell phone. If the new rule is implemented, students will put their cell phones away during class, because they will know as soon as the bell rings, they will have enough free time to text their friends or receive important calls. That way during class, the instructor has their full and undivided attention.

As I said early, students may have to receive urgent and important cell phone calls from their parents, regarding transportation issues and family emergencies. For example, if a student's mother is forced to work a double shift at her minimum wage job and needs to contact her son to tell him to ask, one of his class mates to give a ride or take the bus. He will receive the call, because according to school police, cell phones and all other electronic device should remain off during school. The child will stuck at school wondering, why his mother hasn't picked him up, after waiting long than usual.",0.0
e_eisovgwd,-1,"I think that students should be allowed to use there cell phones during lunch. Because it is there free time and there not in class. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed on in the classrooms, but lunch time. So I would have to agree with policy 1. You should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as there off in the classrooms.

Just in case there is an emergency after school while walking home or waiting for your parents to get them. Students should also be allowed to have them on after school even though it still on school grounds. You the principal or vice principal should allow cell phones on during lunch time, because the students are not bothering anybody it is there free time. So why take them away while there out at lunch?

We just maybe want to listen to music, play games, text, or call people on our cell phones. I honestly believe that it is really not fair that the teachers take away our cell phones while there out during free time or some other activity. Even if your at volleyball tryout's they should be allowed because you're not inside the classrooms disturbing other students your enjoying your own time. Others just want time of there own as they can during school hours, just get a break from all the homework or class work they have to do.

Just for 40 minutes lunch of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time. If you the principal or vice principal agreed on this also probably more students would get better grades in English, Math, History, or Science if you allowed this opportunity to have cell phones out during lunch periods.",0.0

e_3cujpluh,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is a system that was devised in the 18th century, and it is no longer fit for purpose in the 21st century. It is a system that is unfair to voters, it is a system that is undemocratic, and it is a system that is no longer necessary.

The Electoral College is unfair to voters because it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the election because he won more electoral votes.

The Electoral College is undemocratic because it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. For example, Wyoming has a population of only 577,737 people, but it has three electoral votes. California has a population of 39,536,653 people, but it also has only 55 electoral votes. This means that a single vote in Wyoming is worth more than six times as much as a single vote in California.

The Electoral College is no longer necessary. When the Electoral College was created, it was necessary to ensure that the President would be elected by a majority of the states, not just a majority of the people. However, today, we have a national popular vote, and there is no longer any need for the Electoral College.

I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President of the United States by popular vote. This would be a fair, democratic, and necessary reform.

Thank you for your time and consideration.",1.0

First off he give example like,"" Long agio, Venus was probably cover nearly covered oceans and could have supported various froms of life,"" as stated from paragraph 4.

Which in most of the case is actually good news for future explorers, like Venus is the closest planet to earth and in case that earth's not going to be an habitable planet for us humans anymore, we could all move over to Venus because it is the closest plant to us humans living on earth so that we would still have humans living on a planet. in which would also still be closer that mars which could probably get us in bad shape as in space rideing.

Secondly the articles describes that,"" A thick atmosphere blankets Venus. evenind more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuses atmostphere,"" as stated from paragraph 4.

In which in this case its not good news becuase no human life form could probably survive this.

e_7et6v9gq,4,"Driverless cars have been an idea of the past, focusing primarily on safety, and the limiting of car accidents. Although there are numerous dangers along the road, such as accidents, it is possible to make them safe when the driver is unable to control the car. This is, of course, the same question as having a driver behind the wheel. Driverless cars are not a new concept, nor should they continue to be used, due to the fact that the human driver does not have the ability to tell if the car is doing what it should be doing.

The article in section six states that it allows the car to react to situations by detecting things like navigating through construction or road problems. If driverless cars were invented, this could change the way human drivers think, due to human nature reacting to accidents that occur. Humans also tend to swerve away from road work areas when a person is distracted. For example, if someone were to crash, and they weren't paying attention, they could not respond to the danger of crashes as well, as we already have. The passage stated that they would still need human assistance when driving in situations. In this scenario, these cars would not react quickly enough to take over when the driver is not in control over the road. Human drivers have the experience of reacting to situations where they are prone to causing a crash, which brings me to my next reason for not supporting driverless cars.

Whether driverless cars are in control of the vehicle or not, humans are still not perfectly trained to drive. Humans are more prone to driving in certain traffic situations than other vehicles. Drivers will know how to react to the danger they may be facing, but also to know what to do to keep their attention on the road while the car drives itself. These drivers may not pay attention to what is happening around them, because they are not fully alert or ready to take over in case an emergency arises. In addition, the use of driverless cars proves to be very costly, and not a very reliable resource in today's society. Despite the positive aspects of driverless cars, it should not be assumed that the human driving will still have some knowledge of how to handle the situation that is driving behind the wheel.

If driverless cars are incorporated into today's society, they will create a huge number of problems that will hinder the safety of drivers. The text states in section eight, ""The driver should be informed when the vehicle should apply brakes"". A driver would not be focused on the road as much as the driver behind the wheel would. Many drivers will be aware of the warning signs that their car is in danger of backing into an object or backing up their previous attempts to get them to take control over them, and would take over. Even though there is no way in preventing crashes and problems, it could cause problems in traffic and dangerous situations if not taken into account.

Driverless cars may be useful, but they are not the most practical or safe to drive on the roads of today's world and should never be allowed to be created and perfected. A driverless car should not be a popular idea because it causes many distractions, leads to more accidents, and could end up dead before human drivers can even reach the point where the human driver would have to take over the steering wheel. Car companies, especially Google and Facebook, wish that they could bring incar entertainment to better themselves and the safety of passengers. In the future, cars that can drive themselves may become their next big thing. While they may have the potential to become less dangerous, they do not represent the reality of people who drive in the real world.",0.7
e_xyb0ci5f,-1,"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you, in concern of whether we should do community service or not. I believe that we should community service. We should do this because it helps other people and the world. Also it really would get our school notice because of what great thing we are doing.

Most students would say that community service is a waste of time. They say that because they don't really know the reason why they are doing this. Maybe if they do something fun and exciting they would do it. You should really encourage kids to do this because they will feel like they accomplish something and feel better about themselves. I believe if you get a certain amount of kids, more kids will join because those kids will how amazing it is to be ib community service.

The other reason why we should do community service because it's all about helping others. Helping people is rewarding because the person you're helping it would mean the world to them.",0.0
e_4xc4tpo3,4,"My argument of this aspects of the driverless car is that I think it's a great idea. I believe that it will make things better for those that need to get places and may not have the physical capibility to. I think it will save lives because of the sensors that are in the car, if anything goes wrong and the car needs to stop, it would. I also think it would help people get to places faster and that it would help the enviorment with not having to buy gas and also you don't have to get on the roads and waste time. This would also help the enviorment with the fact that they wouldn't have to put gas or oil in their car. Instead of a mechanic telling you to get a tune up, you could just keep doing what you are doing, because it is a sensor vehicle. I think that it will make it less dangerous on the roads with all of the other drivers and also less dangerous for the pedestrians, becuase there are sensors in the car. I do think it's a great idea.",1.0
e_homkc3vb,1,"We should go with changing to election by popular vote for president because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century,the system allows for much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In the case, the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where state delegations vote for president. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina, and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad.

Its official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.",0.0
e_jgb7lcw4,-5,"Summer is a special season for both students and educators. On one hand, many students look forward to long summer vacation as a chance to relax, have fun, and explore new activities many educators, however, view summer vacation as a welldeserved break from the classroom that allows them to spend more time away from the pressures of their jobs. 

Students generally enjoy summer vacation because it's a break from schoolwork and everyday obligations, allowing them to take some time for themselves. During this period, students have adequate time for leisure activities like visiting friends house, going shopping, playing games, etc. Furthermore, the summer offers the perfect opportunity to pursue an extra activity, like an internship, or a summer job. These activities provide students with valuable experience and potentially a source of income. 

On the other hand, some educators believe that summer vacation is a chance to recharge and find a better balance between their professional and personal lives. Long summer vacation gives them a chance to pursue their own interests, such as traveling, engaging in hobbies, or learning something new. It is also a period for catchup work, such as lesson planning and grading, which may not be possible during the school year when teaching time takes priority. 

In conclusion, while educators and students view long summer vacations differently, both can benefit from this extended break. Students use the time to explore and try new things, while educators are able to recharge and catch up on tasks that didnt happen during the school year. For me, summer vacation has always been a wonderful opportunity to pursue creative projects and spend quality time with family and friends.",1.0
e_u3h97z2c,-3,"If you look at the positive side, there is certainly the aspect of driving with low emissions, otherwise known as clean driving. Googles project of creating a driverless taxi service for public transport is something that may well prove to be advantageous. On the one hand it has positive aspects that any society would welcome, but on the other, it has its trustworthiness issues that one cannot easily brush aside. Since the testruns have shown that they are significantly safer than normal traffic, this can be due to the fact that they do not break down or veer off in traffic, but follow the programmed course and can also learn from their experiences while on the road. Fuel economy would also be improved if drivers no longer had to switch between queues and vehicles. Then the most efficient way to go would be the programmed paths that indicated a shortcut and a bypass of the congestion. When it comes to public transport, the benefits would not only be fuel economy, but it would also make cities livelier, for there would no longer be the monotonous, tedious journey to work. The computergenerated fleet of vehicles has the best routing algorithms and most efficient scanning of the surroundings, so that a short cut can be made between the exit and the exit lane, thereby dispersing the traffic load between entry and exit points. On the other hand, there are some safety risks and the need for human intervention, in the event of unforeseen circumstances. When you look ahead, one can safely say that the impact of driverless cars on science and public life will become increasingly pronounced. There are, however, also problems associated with relying on machines to take decisions, such as commercial passenger safety. But the most important issues are that of bringing about an environment of trust, a humane setting and a system of supervision. And then, when you consider the costs involved, such as the taxation structure and the social structures, the emergence of a new kind of public space is something that needs to be carefully considered.",1.0
e_hsz2dpyo,-2,"Studying the literature of various heads can not only bring new knowledge about the past times. Literary sources can also provide valuable information about what views people have on such aspects of life as love, human relationships, or faith. Therefore, Sren Kierkegaards in his work Fear and Trembling conveys his unique vision of religion, which in some way differs from conventional faith. Thus, this work examines the concept of faith and its connection with morality and reasoning in the work of the Danish philosopher.
In his work, Kierkegaard tries to answer the question about the nature and true meaning of faith in human life. With his works, the philosopher made a unique contribution to such disciplines as theology, philosophy, and literature Noble, 2017. Moreover, in his writings, the author gave a new look at the biblical figures in order to highlight their relevance in modern times. According to the Danish philosopher, Christianity carries paradoxes that are offensive to the mind Sren Kierkegaard, 2017. The most important contradiction is following the opinion that the eternal God can simultaneously become a timelimited human being. Sren Kierkegaard determined that morality is a duty to God only if the Almighty determines it. Unlike the generally accepted Christian faith, where it is a divine ethical duty to treat everyone.
In conclusion, this scientific paper considered Sren Kierkegaards work Fear and Trembling. Its peculiarity is that it represents an exceptional view of morality and reasoning. In addition, one of the differences from conventional faith is the opinion that according to the philosopher, if a person chooses faith, then they should not remove their mind. In fact, the author believed that individuals should believe in the absurd.",0.0

e_cco6m5h0,0,"HONK! BEEP BEEP!."" ""Hey! What are you doing!? You're causing a traffic jam!"" What causes a traffic jam? Cars. They get us from point A to B for sure but, do we really need to rely on them that often? I don't think so. As we limit our car usage, the air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happens, and road rage? Gone.

Limiting car usage have many benitfits, such as the air pollution lowers. In some countries, for example Paris, they ban driving due to smog. fter nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. As of that Monday, they would fine motorists with evennumbered license plates a 22euro fine31. The effect of this was that public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians participated in a carfree day leaving the streets traffic jam free. It was their third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted. It didn't stop people from participating even though gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bike with his wife. This campaign began back in the mid1990s. Without cars, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughtout the city. They even fixed the uneven pitted sidewalks and replaced them with smooth sidewalks. A city of 7 million, rush hour have dramatically cut traffic as they have their carfree day.

As for the United States, President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each year go by. Another study has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Without cars, people are expected to walk more and car pool with friends or take buses. This will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas and air pollution. In Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company, has laid out a bussiness plan where they create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and impove safety.

In conclusion, by not driving a car, air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happen, and no traffic jams. From different sources, different effects happens when cars are banned. In Paris, smog is a thing in the past, no traffic jam for a city of 7 million in Bogota, and in Barcelona, public transportations are connected and is faster to get to point A to point B. By not driving cars, we won't cause car accidents and it will improve safety for everyone. Walking never cause problems and can get you anywhere.",0.0
e_71wd76xt,1,"Dear, Senator I'am a conserend voter that believes you should represent the people of your party and should apose the electoral college. It causes an unnecessary complication for voting for who will represent the face of the best country on earth. We the people do not want to get the wrong president to represent the majority of the population. The chances of an undefined out come through electoral college may be low but when it comes down to the presidency nothing should be left to chance.

The voters should know how the system of voting for president. They are the ones that decide so they should know how there vote can be used to have the greatest affect. Bradford Plumer states ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate...sometimes"". A democracy is when the people decide the destiny of there country. For them not to know what there chosing takes power out of the hands of the people.

The Winnertakesall system is ok when your on the playground as a childs it does not work in the real world. This system creates Swing States. according to Richard A. Posner ""method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states"". This draws attention away from other states. Bradford Plumer explained that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"". He also clames ""putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio"". This is not right each vote should be just as important as another and no state should be the deciding outcome in an election.

Chance is a crazy thing. If there is a chance of something happening and it's given time it will happen. A number of weird outcomes can happen with electoral college. One outcome is the possibility of having a tie. Richard A. Posner explains""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number"". If a tie happens the represenetives vote for the people and because each state has one vote per electoral college...""55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon voters."". Second posible out come is the majority vote goes to one canadite and the electoral college goes to the other. For example Bradford Plumer wrote""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" These are just two of the odd outcomes of electoral colleges could cause.

Electoral college don't solve problems but creat them. The best way to put it is this...""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are most assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.",0.0
e_c48hjhln,2,"I don't think the face is really from aliens. I know it can be a little scary to see something like this, but there are other explanations that we could use instead of saying its an alien artifact. The reason why i believe its not actually created by aliens is because if you look at the picture close enough you would notice that it resembles landforms here in America. For example the ""Middle Butte"" in the Snake River Plain in Idaho, and also landform called the ""Messiah"" which looks exactly like the face we found on mars. Some people might say that these kind of formations couldn't have been made naturally,but they were. There are many reasons why i am confident about my idea. Here are some facts to back up what im talking about: NASA has spent so much money into finding out whether or not life exists on another planet and after all those years of research they haven't found anything yet. If there was any way for humans to live on mars or any other planets then they wouldn't hesitate to tell us everything they have discovered so far. As said in paragraph 12 ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This quote basically says that if it wasn't for the shadws making it look like an actual human being then nobody probably would have even noticed the thing in the first place. Another good point i have is that according to paragraph 7 if the object actually looked like an alien monument than the authors felt it would have been a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars. It just didn't happen though because no body thought it was interesting enough for them to want to talk about. So therefore with all these points i've given you its impossible for me to imagine that there could possibly be life on another plant. We still need more time to figure things out, but the odds are pretty low.",0.9
e_alufbjqz,2,"I think that the face is just a natural landform because, there are many similar ones around Cydonia and they were also there before Viking 1 even went to take pictures of it. The face has been in movies for years and you can find all types of theories about it but, it was just a mesa or a rock formation with shadows that formed something like an Egyptian Pharaoh's face. But I understand how people would want it to be an alien artifact, i know what it seems like, but its not. It was discovered by NASA's Viking 1 on June 5th, 1976. They thought at first that it could have been some type of ancient civilization. But then scientists found out that it wasn't anything special after all. A few days later they sent another spacecraft called Viking 2 up to take more photos of the ""Face"" as we call it now. When the images came back from the second mission they saw nothing but, a rock formation. This happened to me too! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that my computer screen showed us a normal landform. All it had was some shadows and bumps which made it look like an Egyptain Pharoah.

So I guess you can say that the story was over but then it started again. On April 5th 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took new highresolution pictures of the face. Some of the pictures were ten times sharper than the original ones taken back in 1976. After they got the pictures back he noticed that it reminded him of Middle Butte in Snake River Plane of Idaho. There were no other signs or things that looked like they were built by aliens, so he told everyone that it must have been one of those Martian Mesa's which was common around the area of Cydonia. He said that maybe it was JUST a huge rock formation. And yes, there were other photos taken on April 8th, 1998.

But still skeptics didn't agree with the facts that the scientists provided them with. So on April 8th, 2001, they flew past the ""face"" once again. It was winter time in Apriil '01 and cloudy in Mars, but Garvin and his crew snapped three really good quality pictures using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. These cameras were thirtythree times better than the ones used by the Vikings. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs exploration program says, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" And thats why the Face on Mars looks like an egyption Pharoah and that it was a martian mesa.",0.9
e_9j11tor6,-2,"Genetics are such a strange thing, such a bizarre coincidence of DNA and traits. Take me for example. I have a very unique genome. Immutable, my doctor calls it. Apparently that means that even when bitten by a vampire, attacked by a werewolf, or even cursed by magic, I remain human. Stubbornly so, in fact. I'm nearly 1400 years old, yet another strange trait of my immutable genome. My cells replicate perfectly, giving me a theoretical immortality and I don't really get sick. Like I said, genetics are funny. When I was born, I remember being treated as a freak, someone strange and different. My doctors took a lot of blood and tissue samples, and I remember spending a lot of time with needles in me. Then of course, came the Upheaval.
It started about fifty years after I was born, and it continued for nearly three centuries. Mankind slowly went extinct, our place taken by the supernatural creatures of legends. No one really knows how it started, but it began in Europe. Vampires and Werewolves emerged and began killing and turning everyone they could find. Then came the Fomor, the Seelie and Unseelie, and all the other Gloaming creatures. By the end, every human had been turned or killed, except one. I was kept as a science experiment by one of the vampire lords, a man named Kristoff, who continually subjected me to new methods of turning me. He was actually pretty chill about the whole thing, going out of his way to make sure that I wasn't harmed by his experiments.
Kristoff had enemies though, and eventually he was killed, his household liberated. Thinking I was one of his house, I was cast out into the world, the last human left. Finding a job was easy, since the majority of the new species were nocturnal, jobs that needed to be done throughout the day were in high supply. I work as a solar panel tech, keeping a massive farm of panels working for the Unseelie Court. They could handle the day, but they preferred the night, and they hated iron and steel, meaning it was difficult for them to manage their solar farms. Enter me, their werewolf tech. I'm not really a werewolf, but it means I get a three day paid vacation every month at the full moon, a vacation I use to go fishing.
The Unseelie are actually pretty great bosses, definitely misrepresented in human literature. They have a ton of rules, and they apply to workers, meaning I get paid excellently and I have a great benefits package. My doctor, working with patient confidentiality, knows I am human, and helps me manage. He files reports saying I'm a werewolf and he's been super helpful getting me meals that are balanced, sneaking me supplements to assist my meatfilled diet. Basically, he's my rock. Fortunately for me, he's a Elder Fae, and is more immortal than I am, so I don't have to worry about a new doctor every hundred years or so.
He's been fascinated by my genome, just like Kristoff was, and I do my best to make sure he has lots of samples. I figure keeping him happy is the least I can do. As the world's oldest and only human, I keep my head down and watch as the world changes. When the Upheaval first happened, the technology level dropped significantly, until the supernatural creatures began to understand humanity's technology. Now, my Fae doctor takes MRIs, uses 3D Holo Matrices to plot my genome, and does scans using long wave light scans. Not only did the supernatural creatures understand our technology, they also resumed our expansion. Now, nearly 1400 years later, the Earth is a utopia, each race wellrepresented and welltreated. As a human born in the the late 1900s, I wake up every day fascinated by how the world has changed. Floating cities, space travel, and even flying cars, have now become the norm.
All in all then, this world's not so bad. I make a good living, I have lots of friends, and I recently started seeing an Unseelie Fae, a girl named Mashian, who's even older than I am. I've even been thinking of sharing my secret with her, so hopefully she's okay dating a human. Anyway, that's life in 1358 A.U. It's different that I expected when I was a kid, but it's not bad. Not bad at all.",0.0
e_jflp9wh7,5,"I am for the Facial Action Coding System, it could be very useful to many different situations. The FACS can read peoples emotions and tell how they are feeling by just looking at their facial features. It would help with so much because you don't have to guess how someone is feeling or what there emotion is.

The FACS is valuable in a classroom setting. If the student was sad or angry about something the teacher may know and ask them what is wrong or if they need any assistance. In paragraph 6 it states that ""A class room computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means that the computers can see when students do not understand something or don't care enough to try. The teachers then will be able to get more attention on those certain students.

This technology can also show if someone is being deceptive and lying about their feelings towards things. In paragraph 7 it says ""For instance, you can probably tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" which shows that you as a human can identify how someones feels but sometimes people like to hide their true emotions from others. So using this technology we can tell exactly how someone is really feeling and stop them before they do anything bad or harmful to themselves.

So overall I think that the FACS is going to be valuable to our society today. We can use this technology to prevent suicides, bullying, cheating, etc. And it helps teachers know whether their students are understanding everything they are teaching them. With all of these reasons I believe this technology should be used everywhere and anywhere.",0.9
e_261rd45x,-1,"Dear Principle,

I believe that only allowing students with a grade B average to play sports is wrong and unfair. This is because without sports, students will lose their hobbies and it can get in the way of sporting careers that they may want to follow. Students can also get scholarships for sports which can help a lot if they're not strong in other subjects.

Some students only like one thing. Sports. If they can't do the one thing they enjoy they may give up in school which will only lower their grades. Banning sports from the majority of the school might also lead the school to forfeit their games because they might not have enough players to play the game.

Another reason why this rule is unfair is because maybe a student is aiming to get a scholarship in college from their athleticism. This is because they want to go to college to get a good job but might have a hard time making it because they aren't doing so well in school. Therefore, students start sports to go to a good college.

To achieve a good sporting career, many students start on school sports teams and gradually get better and better at the sport they love. If students aren't allowed to play on the sports team just because they have an average grade in school they can't follow their career of choice and they might end up with a job that they do not enjoy.

As you can see, banning sports from the majority of the school can lead to students lowering their grades and the school forfeiting their games. This also takes away the rights of students. This rule should not be made because it is unfair to most of the students.",0.0

I'm a scientist at NASA, and I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

Body:
1. According to the article, the Face was discovered in 2004 by a team of researchers.
2. The Face is a long, narrow valley that stretches for hundreds of miles.
3. The valley is filled with natural features that could have created the Face, including hills, rocks, and sand.
4. The Face is located on the Martian surface, which means it was not created by aliens.

Conclusion:
The Face on Mars is a natural landform that was created by natural processes. I believe that the Face is just one of many similar formations on the Martian surface, and that NASA should continue exploring the planet to find more of these fascinating features.",1.0

It can easily be seen from earths safe distance and is the second planet from sun. But Venus posed to be a big challange in studying it more close. Venus have a dense atmoshere and a surface tempeture more extream than mercuries surface despite being further from sun. But what make Venus an interesting subject to study? Venus and Mars orbits the sun at different speeds which mean sometime Venus is just a stone through away. Venus can potentially host oceans and life forms like on Earth. Also Venus geology and atmospheares similar to earth. This is very imp for us to study, Venus. It can tell us about early history on earth as Venus can potentially have oceans too like on early earth. This will help us predict and prepare for earth climate changing and ocean warming issues. Scientist can learn about weather on earth as Venus atmosphere have sulferic clouds and high tempeture wind. Scientist can also learn about volcanoes, geological activities, how it effect atmosphere.

Venus atmosphere of almost 97 precent of carbon dioside can tell us about the future earths fate with climate changes and rising ocean. Also Venus atmosphere of highly corecive sufuric clouds and tempeture of more than 450c and preasure of almost a kilomter over earth can tell about what could happends when earth overheat and become over pressure with greenhouse gases and ocean. Venus geology and geograhe like valley, mountain, crater is very important for geologist to learn about and compare with geologist on earth like on mars.

Venus can potentially be covered with life once. Its geological activity can tell about earth past geological events which leaded to ocean. Also Venus atmosphere of highly corecive sulfiric clouds can lead us to study earth atmosphere which leaded to early forms of life. Its not a easy tasks to land probes to Venus due to extreme atmospheric preasure of almost a kilometer over earth which could liquid many forms of metall. Even with a submarine design with special metall can not survive Venus. Venus atmosphere can even destroy electronic circuits. Scientist can overcome this by studying the atmospheric composition. If scientist learn about this then probes with special metall can withstand it for few minutes and can gather more datas for future studies. Scientist can overcome the weather on Venus as Venus have constant strong lightening and erruption. But the challage is to make probes able to withstand lightening and erruption for some time as scientist have to study these. But there is a hope for studying Venus without any dangers to probes with blimp like hover craft hovering in atmosphere of Venus. Venus have a dense atmosphere which can hold a blimp like hover craft in its atmospher. At an altitude of about thirty plus kilometers above the Venus' surface temperature and preasure is like earth and probes with a blimp can collect data without any fear. Venus can potentially host ocean and maybe life. But the challenges scientist have to over come to land probe is to study and over come Venus dense atmosphere, temperature, weather condition.

e_o8jk0rqr,-3,"The Mars face has become one of the most popular and discussed mysteries of the space age. The Mars face has been claimed by many conspiracy theorists to be irrefutable proof of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. The appearance of the face was first seen by a remote sensing satellite in 1976 and has since been identified as a composition of clay, rock, and rustcolored soil, arranged by nature in a pattern resembling a human face with one large eye. However, in 2006, when a higherresolution image was taken of the face by NASA, it was clear that it was a natural geological formation. The controversy was thus ended. Despite the anticlimactic discovery, the attention given to the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence highlighted the mystery, the fascination, and the theories behind the universe and the solar system. The mystery vanished into obscurity, to become another mysterious legend attesting to the astrological beauty.

In the text it says that these cars have driven more than half million miles without a crash. And yes they are expensive but still to can save up on money or even get a good job to buy one I m sure you can get it from somewhere cheaper. These driverless driven cars are also helpful for people who have injuries such as a broken leg or even people who can t drive. You can drink and don t have to worry about getting into a car crash. In the text it asked why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Well that s not the case. Either way it goes you will need someone to ride in the car because how do you expect to go to your location? If you needed to go to the doctor and you didn t just like driving then have a driverless car that will drive you out for you. Get it it? So yes i believe that this driverless car is worth it for the people who don t like to drive but always busy or people who can t drive or even people who are injured. Im not that that that is want to drive but i know people who don t like do drive. I have heard people say that they think they need someone who to drive them out for them. I m not that that that but I believe that this driverless car is something that should want to buy.,0.05

The sheer sides of the crevice looked like they would offer no purchase if I tried to climb up them. ""How far did I fall?""

The smog has risen to its high levels due to the mass of car usage on roads that pollute and destroy the atmosphere that causes this huge dilemma in these countries . A solution has been made to lower this problem of air pollution, and that's reducing or lowering carownership in suburb areas. A great plan has made in European country Germany called Vauban that's made on carreducing.
In European country Germany there is a district of Vauban which has made this idea of eliminating vehicles as the primary mode of transportation around it. They made rules such that street parking is not available on most of their roadway, no driveways or garagespaces are permitted on any homes within this district of Germany. In addition carownership has been made legal, yet if someone wants or needs to own a vehicle they need to purchase space that costs around forty thousand dollars on top of your home in this district of Vauban . Therefore due to these rules made within Vauban Germany there has been made of 57 percent that has already sold there car and over 70 percent of families that live without car ownership at all within district of Vauban of this county.
""It gives people who walk or ride their bike or ride public transit or carshare a sense of space that isnt overwhelmed by the noise, danger and air pollution of automobiles according Heidrun Walter of Germany. These changes within Vauban has caused families of this district of Germany has made more relaxed and calm on roadways of district of Germany of Germany according Heidrun Walter.
The idea of lowering of carbon emission that comes directly from passenger vehicles has brought much positive light upon European country Germany and other suburbs that would like lower car pollution on roadways of those suburbs . According European studies carreduction on roadways can make huge impacts on lower of carbon emissions of passenger vehicles that makes of over twelve percents on European continent that has lower car pollution around European continent of European continent of Germany of Germany .
Moreover lowering of car pollution has made on roadways within suburbs of European continent. According American expert of car pollution it has made lower of over fifty percent of passenger vehicle on roadways that can be lowered on American counties that lower car pollution around American continent of American continent of Germany of Germany . Thus lowering of passenger vehicle that lower of air pollution that can be lowered on roads of Germany of Germany of German continent of Germany of German continent of American continent that lower of car pollution around American continent .
Thus carreducing on roads of Germany has helped much within reducing carbon emissions of passenger vehicles of German continent. European suburbs of Germany has made lower car ownership that can cause less traffic congestions on roadways of Germany of German continent. European suburbs that lower car pollution has made lower noise of roadways of Germany of German continent of Germany of European continent . Therefore German suburbs that lower of car pollution has made lower air pollution around European continent .",1.0

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the upcoming election and to urge you to support the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a system that gives voice to states and helps ensure that the is chosen on the votes of Americans, not the densely populated states. It is important that the president be chosen based on the wishes of all Americans, not just the residents of a few large states.

STATE SENATOR, I am a high school student who is enthusiastic about the upcoming election. However, I lack focus. I would like to encourage you to support the Electoral College, which is a system that gives voice to smaller states and helps ensure that the president is chosen based on the votes of all Americans, not just the residents of a few large states. Thank you for your time and consideration.",1.0
e_mvi6mwi2,6,"The author of  The challenge of Exploring Venus suggests that studying venus is worth pursuing despite the dangers it presents. There are many reasons why we should study Venus, but there are also many risks to it as well. Venus has a lot to offer if we could get past the obstacles that stand in our way of learning more about this planet and all its features.

Venus has been called Earth's twin because they have some similarities such as size, density, and distance from the sun. This would be really helpful for us humans since Earth can no longer sustain us due to pollution and other factors. We need somewhere else to go so we don't end up dying off. Also, with Venus being so close to earth we wouldn't have too far to travel which is very important when looking at fuel efficiency. As said by the author in paragraph 2 Astronomers are fascinated by Venus becaues it may once have been the most Eathlike planet in our solar system. So we would want to know how to make it inhabitable again or what caused it to lose those characteristics. It might even help us better understand ourselves.

There are ways around the issues like extreme heat and high pressure that come along with exploring Venus, however, we still haven't found a solution yet. NASA has an idea on using old technology that was invented during WWII called mechanical computers. These were first used before electronics were invented and these devices will use gears and levers to perform calculations instead of the delicate electronic components that today's machines contain. Another plan is to hover above the surface of Venus without coming into contact with it. They believe that temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close enough to sea level here on earth. Radiation levels wouldnt exceed Earths, so people would survive just fine. The only problem is you wouldnt be able to take any samples back to examine because of the conditions inside the blimp. You would need to do everything right then and there.

In conclusion I agree with the authors opinion. Studying Venus would benefit us greatly not only in understanding the world itself but in preparing for future generations who will inhabit it. We cannot keep destroying the one place we live now. If we learn how to live on another planet than everyone will feel safer knowing that they wont die alone. We should pursue further exploration and experimenting on the planet Venus.",0.9
e_4pxjsgl5,-2,"Introduction:
Cash transfer programs have gained international attention as a means to alleviate poverty and enhance social wellbeing. This essay aims to evaluate the impact of cash transfers on females, focusing on their effects on HIV reduction, labor opportunities, empowerment, and dependence on farming and informal activities. Moreover, it will explore the potential benefits of safe and wellpaid jobs for women in terms of reducing child marriage, teen pregnancy, psychological distress, and HIV prevalence. Lastly, by considering the duration of the program and the necessity for further research, we will analyze the longterm effects of cash transfers.
Body:
I. HIV Reduction:
Cash transfers have proved to be influential in reducing the prevalence of HIV among females. These programs provide economic resources that reduce women's vulnerabilities, enabling them to seek healthcare services, including HIV testing, treatment, and prevention measures. By empowering women to make informed decisions about their health, cash transfers contribute significantly to the reduction of HIV transmission rates.
II. Labor Opportunities and Empowerment:
Cash transfer programs have the potential to enhance women's labor opportunities and empowerment. By providing financial support, these programs enable women to access education and training, expand their skill sets, and secure wellpaid employment. Increasing women's participation in safe and wellpaid jobs contributes to their empowerment, allowing them to exercise broader control over their lives and choices.
III. Dependence on Farming and Informal Activities:
Cash transfers offer alternatives to women who are solely dependent on farming and informal activities for their livelihoods. By providing economic resources, these programs empower women to explore new economic opportunities outside traditional industries. This diversification of income allows women to move away from agriculture and informal activities, reducing their reliance on these sectors while promoting their economic independence and resilience.
IV. Benefits of Safe and WellPaid Jobs:
Safe and wellpaid jobs for women have farreaching benefits including the reduction of child marriage, teen pregnancy, psychological distress, and HIV prevalence. When women have access to stable employment with fair wages, they are less likely to resort to child marriage or engage in transactional relationships that increase the risk of HIV transmission. Furthermore, employment provides financial stability, reducing instances of teen pregnancies and promoting healthier familial environments. Additionally, safe and wellpaid jobs contribute to improved mental health by reducing psychological distress associated with economic insecurity.
V. Analyzing Longterm Effects of Cash Transfers:
The duration of cash transfer programs is crucial in determining their longterm effects on female beneficiaries. Shortterm programs may offer immediate relief, but sustainable change requires a longterm commitment. By designing cash transfer interventions that extend over an extended period, governments and organizations can facilitate lasting changes in women's lives, promoting their socioeconomic wellbeing through sustained support.
VI. Necessity for Further Research:
While cash transfer programs have demonstrated positive impacts on females in various aspects, further research is needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their effectiveness. Continual evaluation and analysis of these programs will shed light on nuances specific to different contexts, enabling policymakers to refine their approaches and maximize the potential benefits for women.
Conclusion:
Cash transfer programs have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing the lives of women. By evaluating their impact on HIV reduction, labor opportunities, empowerment, and dependence on farming and informal activities, we recognize the transformative potential these programs hold. Safe and wellpaid jobs for women have proven to mitigate child marriage, teen pregnancy, psychological distress, and HIV prevalence. However, it is essential for cash transfer programs to be implemented over extended periods to generate sustainable change. Future research endeavors should continue to explore the effectiveness of cash transfers, fostering evidencebased policies that contribute to the longterm wellbeing of women.",1.0
e_steat9o8,1,"dear mister senator, i'm writing this to argue about keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. This system of voting has been proven to be very unfair to the citizens and should be gotten rid of.

we've had a lot of trouble on the goverment in the past when the system of electoral college was created,and that's just one of the many reasons why i think we need to just get rid of it. The electoral college doesn't really feel like part of the government,it is a bunch of people who work there jobs,how they live,etc.

This system is flawed because it is basically unfair to those who vote for the other president because,the electoral college is not what we need for a straight forward election. yes,it has worked fine over 60 percent of the time,and i don't know you think it is. its the best system around,

but the thing is that most of us will not really understand what a group of people thinks,and whats really wrong with it. the system is also called ""disaster factor"",which refers to sources 3 & 4 says that we are the people to choose our leaders.it happened in 2000 when gore had less pccss than bush,but it has been in the same precidence as bush since 1888. i know for a fact that the Electoral college work was great before,and it would've been better back then.but its gonna take time to do anything about it. this is why we should ban the electoral college and switch to a straight forward election. thats just a few of the negative things that can go wrong with it because if it was abolished,it would have been so much easier and fair for all of us. so,we should get rid of it so that way we can vote for our president directly,and keep our rightful right to vote on who we think should win. i don't think it should be taken out of our voting system because it is messed up by this system.

this was created in the 1800s,but it is not fair to us. we should keep this system the same,its unfair and outdated. this is why i propose you to get rid off or abolish the electoral college. be the new founding father mister senator.",0.7
e_ccb7d7rx,-1,"Does working on a school project during your summer vacation sound fun to you? Instead of going out to the beach and see the red flower sun, would you rather stay inside a cold and damp house with flickering electricity, and waste your time doing work for school? For me, I'd choose the beach, no questions asked. Since I'm a teenager in high school, I know a thing or two about wanting some freedom for myself. Summer projects should be student designed, as much as it is beneficial for a student to rememberthe past lessons they've learned in school, hardworking students especially, deserve time for themselves to experience joy and free time from the hard workthey've paid off doing. If summer projects were to all be student designed, students won't have to worry about time management, the work wouldn't be the issue, and the students would be doing the work for the teachers.

Summer projects should be student designed, because students wouldn't have to worry about time management. It really depends on the students schedules, for example, if a student works on a student designed project, and plays a sport in the summer like for instance soccer, the work could easily be completed if the student balances his or her time wisely, maybe playing soccer like at nine fifty in the morning, and working on the student designed project at one fifty in the afternoon, could balance the students time easily. Another example on how students wouldn't have to worry about time management is that, students could also make time to spend time with their families, if they ever plan on going to their cousins birthday, or go to their brothers or sisters sport games, students can choose what times work for them, and their work would have to be their second priority.

Summer projects should be student designed, because the work wouldn't be the issue. When students make work for themselves, they tend to understand what their own assignment or tasks mean to themselves. For example, students can make their own projects by using websites such as adobe spark or prezi. com , and can also make their own projects on Google PowerPoint. if the student knows how he or she could benefit themselves on making their own work, then the students can accomplish on being their own teacher. Another example on how the work wouldn't be the issue, is that the work itself would not be difficult to get done. when students make their own work, it may not have the same work level like a teachers work, but it can still be educational and it can be easier. If a student designed project was created on Google PowerPoint, then that would not be difficult to get done.

Summer projects should be student designed, because the students would be doing the work for the teachers. The student is literally taking the role as a teacher to him or herself. For example, if a teacher is planning to go to Hawaii for the summer, but doesn't have time to create the project for him or herself, then they could ask their students for assistance on that. The students would be in charge of doing the work for the teachers and that could also help with the teachers time management. Another example of how the students would be doing the work for the teachers, if a teacher doesn't show up for summer school and if he or her is absent for it, then they could ask one of their own students to probably be one of the substitute teachers for the summer school.

In conclusion, even if teacher designed projects could also be beneficial to a certain group of students, the knowledge being given to the students mind won't make as much of an impact as a student designed project would. People tend to forget that not all teenagers come from the same mentality of not being hard workers or not smart enough, every person in this world has their own intelligence within themselves, people just tend to forget and start to believe that they don't have a smart mentality. If teachers can have enough trust in their students and be willing to ask them for help, then that should be a sign that summer projects can be student designed. Therefore, if there are not enough teachers who can help make the projects for students in the summer, then students can try to help with that if they want to.",0.0
e_d3fcuyzm,4,"Driving is the most common thing in our country. In our modern age, we have developed cars to drive us places and places. They seem to work just fine, but there are too many concerns that a driverless car could cause. One of them is in danger of getting hit by an accident. Another concern could be that there is danger while the car is driving itself. Driverless cars would be very dangerous to everyone, not only the driver, but everyone around it as well. Your biggest concerns would be the manufacturing of the car, and the safety of everyone around it.

If driverless cars became a thing, we would need to be alert at all times. The driverless cars would have a lot of sensors around it in case of emergency. The whole car would need to be notified at all times if something unexpected would happen. People who are on the road would most likely get into accidents or be injured in some way. When the car's sensors do fail, you would get seriously injured or even worse, it would be your job to ensure that everything is safe before it is used to drive. Getting these safety features fixed would save everyones life, just like it should be.

Not only would a driverless car create accidents, but it would also put the passengers at risk, so everyone around the vehicle would need to be alert. They would be worried about people crashing into them due to the fact that the car isn't working correctly. Also, if it has an accident, that person could get injured and be seriously injured. If the computer crashes into a vehicle and someone is injured or injured, who's fault could it be? If this happens, you would always be in trouble, not paying attention, and that could cause you to get arrested or put into jail. You can always take your eyes off of the road and not let another person get in the way of something that you just want to know about.

Even though having a driverless car seems like such a good idea, there could be many things to go wrong. For example, if you are going to make the final decision on who gets in control of your vehicle, it is best that you pay attention to what's going on around you. Some could argue that you should be alert when you are not in control of the vehicle. You should always keep your eyes open for anything, including the road work, to prevent any possible accidents from occuring. However, there are still risks to the driverless car and if there is one, the human being would be at fault.

It would be nice to travel around the world with less people on the road, but the actual problem is that the cars will not be as safe as they would have been. Also the technology that is used to encase the car will fail. If someone gets injured, how are you going to get help for the vehicle and to whom you're in charge of? Driverless cars aren't always the safest.",0.7
e_5jp5zw1e,4,"Driverless cars? A car doing all the driving for you without you having to touch the wheel is of lazy. Why would you want a ""smar car"" do all the work for you. The more that the technology develops the more things people find to help you be more lazy. It's like people don't want to do anything themselves anymore.

When driving you really have to pay attention to not just yourself but other people. If you let the smart car drive you around it's not going to really be paying attention to other people. If you get in an accident and the other person gets hurt, who is to blame you, or the car? The cops will go with you, because you are an human being that can get arrested and pay insurance, not the car. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?""

So, I don't think we should have driverless cars. I believe there would be more accidents than there is now. When it comes down to it yes, this will be our future, but we can also prevent it from happening. Its all up to you.",0.0

e_s43e2mch,-7,"Should humans be able to use cell phones while driving Humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents and even worse death. The National Safety Council today stated that state and state need to limit the use of cell phones and textmessaging devices while driving. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. A study from the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis estimates that cell phone use while driving contributes to 6 percent of crashes which equates to 636 000 crashes 330 000 injuries 12 000 serious injuries and 2 600 deaths each year. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Cell phone use contributes to 6 of crashes and drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash. Smartphones have made it easy for us to be connected at all times. But they can pose serious problems accidents if someone decides to take them or take video messages, phone calls or any other phone applications while driving. Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. Worst of all the usage of cell phones before car accidents happen is known to be underreported due to potential legal issues. Using a mobile phone is be is reckless, and every single crash that is due to it could be prevented. The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands free device via Bluetooth. The hands free device does not guarantee safety either. While the distraction from using such technology is significantly smaller it might still cause an accident. So there is no better decision than to simply postpone calls until you have arrived at your destination. In conclusion humans should not be able to use cell cell phone while driving driving because it can cause accidents and even worse accidents.",0.05

e_72us30ak,-1,"Most of the time when a student comes back from school they go home and relax, procrastinate and maybe do their homework this is most students, but not all. Extracurricular activities can either be fun and exhilirating or dull and exhausting it all depends on what the student enjoys doing. If a student loves to move around all the time, they don't want to just sit around and do nothing. Student's that enjoy wastingthier time doing unnecesary things, suffer from it. If someone was to be placed with their friends doing something that they usually wouldn't do, they would do it, because that is the influence your friends have on you. If your friends like to skip class, you are eventually going to skip class. If your friends are excellent in school, you will be excellent in school. I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college. I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues and it could reduce stress.

Extracurricular activities would help students do something productive, instead of wasting their time by making sure that they alsways keep themselves busy and get them to understand that you can never get time back, once it's gone, it's never coming back, so they should do something productive with it that will help them in the future. Hopefully they can teach those students, to do something now, that your future self will thank you for. Extracurricular activities can help students overcome their struggles, for example if a student who procrastinates took joined a club for time management they would learn ways to finish their work on time and not worry about overdue assignments. In order for students to succeed in school and be succesfull in the future, there are certain obstacles they must overcome in order to succeed hopefully extracurricular activities can do just that.

For the students trying their hardest to get into college, your GPA and SAT scores are not the only thing Colleges look at. Colleges and Universities want to see the kind of person you are, otherwise we're all just numbers what that means is, if Colleges see that someone was on the student council or was the president of their club, they are going to be impressed by it, because it shows that that person has leadership skills, and colleges need leaders, not followers. There has been numerous occasions when an average studeent that participated in activities got accepted by their dream college as opposed to an excellent student that never participated in activities and got declined by the college they applied to why? Because colleges can't see the type of person you are and what skills you possess based off of test scores and how well you did on an assignment, a letter does not define you. Just because someone did well on a test than another doesn't mean they are better than the other. The way the schooling system works is like a puzzle some students fit in that puzzle, others don't.

Extracurricular activities with friends is fun and exhilirating your friends make you laugh and make you happy, happiness releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a wonderfull mood. However not everyone has friends and not everyone has social skills. Those that are socially akward, can create a club and learn how to talk to poeple so they can make friends. Clubs, and sports are all extracurricular activities that involve others and the more you hang around a person the more comfortable you are around them the easier it is to talk to them and become friends . People will mental health issues or have stress from school can go to their extracurricular activity to relax and have a good time. As it states in paragraph two, extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels., dopamines reduce depression and anxiety furthermore mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.

I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college.

I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues, it could also reduce stress. Student's that procrastinate and waste their time, have friends that do the same. They can meet new people with better habbits and join clubs to help overcome that so they can better their performance in school. Hopefully they can teach those students to do something now, your future self will thank you for. As for Colleges, they want to see personality, otherwise we're all just numbers, and colleges don't want numbers they want bright people. If you show leadership skills in clubs or sports, colleges will be impressed by it, because colleges need leaders, not followers. As for mental health, friends make you laugh and make you happy, feeling happy releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a great mood. Extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels, dopamines reduce depression and anxiety so mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.

Yes, Yes driverless cars are a great idea, and in the near future they will not fail to prove themselves or change the economy. Driverls cars are a new invention by Google , who's cofounders want there city safer an smarter for other peopl... To begin my first idea .It ws said in paragraph 1 that

""Tesla has had aspirations of "" creating a ' driverless' car that would not only drive,and notify it to the driver if danger was approaching. It could even park itself,"" paragraph 1, That could not be done with some type of drviver assistance and it would be so much cheaper then paying some crazy high price to a mechanic to fix there problem of breaking down.

They could pay them 2 to get started as well as paying for gas while being lazy as they drive themselves with a motor for all thr vehicles in to work together as one .With that driverless cars that would drive as and by them self they would not need gas and they have an assistiant to make to work,so they would really have no need for people not a car to sit still by its self and waste gas that is going nowhere.""It alows the driverless cars to assist the drevner of thier car."" paragraph 1, pargraagh 5 , and 8.With out that the car should drive more as there is not much need since the car can have human like skills to navigate them self with out the drivers assisting. ""If they know they will always know, if their car goes down on it will only help them, the only change that will make sure your not going to do damage is not having a computer to tell them which way you are trying to go .It will stop or go if any situation come or go ."" paragaph 5,paragraph 8, paragragh 2,2,and7 for my other idea.

Driver's cars as of now in this technology day and age , and since driverless car has gone into development people may be nervous , hesant just down right confused. It should really make some human's more relaxed with being able to know that ""It may have an assistinat to assist thier car and not let any accidents get out of there cite.""paragraph 5,8,1,2 for anothere one of my ideas. People should try and use there brains for some thing if anthign .

The opportunity to travel the world while working on America's tall ships is truly unique. Through Seagoing Cowboys, I was able to visit amazing destinations like Australia, Croatia, and Portugal that I otherwise may never have seen. Sailing across vast oceans and visiting foreign ports gave me a sense of adventure like nothing I had experienced before. Each new place offered breathtaking scenery and immersed me in different cultures. I gained a broader perspective by learning about the diverse traditions, foods, and ways of life in each new region.

Not only did I broaden my horizons through international travel, but I also learned invaluable life skills. On the tall ships, everyone must pitch in to safely operate the vessel through all waters. Tasks like navigating, climbing the rigging, and learning maritime knots taught me the value of teamwork, responsibility, and perseverance in challenging conditions. Gaining proficiency in sailing pushed me out of my comfort zone and built my selfconfidence in managing unexpected situations. The lifetime memories and personal growth from this handson learning are truly priceless. 

The Seagoing Cowboys program also affords the opportunity to meet interesting people from all walks of life. I bonded with my crewmates who came from different backgrounds but were united in their spirit of adventure. We supported each other through challenging moments and celebrated accomplishments together. I know the lifelong friendships I formed will always be remembered fondly. 

In closing, I hope I have convinced you of the lifechanging impact of participating in Seagoing Cowboys. The chance to see the world from the deck of a tall ship, learn nautical skills, and form priceless relationships make it an unparalleled experience. If you have the spirit of discovery and desire an educational adventure, I highly recommend applying today. You will not regret broadening your horizons through this amazing program.",1.0

In the article, the author uses lots inferences that are supporting his use of the software to read the student's emotions.

This is one of the few things that could help alot with the use of technology to help better educating the children in this day and time.

e_gfaj5hn8,-2,"Analysts Predict Unlikely Protracted Strike by United Auto Workers Against General Motors

Contract negotiations between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors have stalled in recent days, raising the possibility of the first nationwide UAW strike against GM in over a decade. However, industry analysts say a protracted work stoppage that significantly impacts GM's operations is unlikely. 

The UAW's fouryear contract with GM expired on Saturday at midnight. Despite ongoing talks, the two sides remain far apart on key issues like pay raises, health care costs, and the use of temporary workers. The union has over 48,000 members at dozens of GM factories and parts depots across the US.

A strike by the UAW would disrupt GM's vehicle production and cost the company millions of dollars per day in lost profits. However, analysts point out that the UAW faces pressure to avoid a long strike that could hurt both GM's business and workers' paychecks. 

""Neither side wants a long, painful strike that causes economic harm,"" said Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. ""The costs would be too high for both GM and UAW members who lose wages and benefits during a strike.""

Most experts predict that if the union were to initiate a strike, it would likely be a shortterm action meant to force GM back to the negotiating table. Even a brief strike could slow or stop production at some US plants, cutting off supply lines and affecting GM's Canadian and Mexican operations. But within days, the two sides would probably renew talks and come to an agreement, analysts say. 

""A strike threat is a common negotiating tactic, but once workers actually walk out, both sides start losing money immediately,"" said Arthur Wheaton, an auto industry professor at Cornell University. ""There's strong motivation to settle as quickly as possible."" Wheaton expects a final deal within 12 weeks at most if a brief strike were to take place.

GM and the UAW have been down this road before, with strikes in 1970, 1972, and 1992, along with a 54day shutdown of American Axle & Manufacturing, a major GM supplier, in 2008. But much has changed, and GM cannot afford a longterm work stoppage that delays new vehicle launches and sales. For its part, the UAW is under pressure to protect union jobs as the auto industry continues evolving. Both sides want an agreement, not a protracted standoff, experts say. Barring a major breakdown in talks, analysts expect a typical eleventhhour deal and workers remaining on the job.",1.0

Lloyds agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought against it the fifth such settlement IMRO has made with firms that have been found guilty of improper sales of pension products. IMRO said Lloyds did not obtain or have systems to obtain all relevant facts about the personal and financial circumstances of its customers needed to advise them properly about pensions transfers.

e_obwvygrv,-3,"Scientist Albert Einstein has said, "" Imagination is not important than knowledge"". I agree with him because I think imagination is like a musk because if u can imagine something and imagine it, it will be easier than imagining, but i say it's more easy because it shows you how to draw. 

 It shows that imagination can be good for some things like math, reading, or something. For example you can do your home work when you are bored, and you don't have to worry about homework because you have ur own projects to do and that will help you with school work or in your future job. In some schools the students just have imagination and when they get to the school or school they wont be doing their projects because they will do everything by them self, like for example when I was in high school in Generic_City the first time they came to this school but they didnt know what they were doing,and then they started to tell their teachers and parents how their school is so good that way they are doing something right now and it not going to help us for the future like when we go back to college we can use imagination more and more because imagination helps us in school and in our jobs. but when there was no imagination there is no need for imagination at all because we need knowledge to get things done. Thats why it is important that people are trying to come up with more ideas that they think can help with the job and what we are studying for. When your thinking of something you always think about somethings and then you start to think that your gonna do something with it that you never think you will get good results. Its not hard to see the outcome of you doing and having more imagination than you do because your mind is telling you what you want your work to be or what kind of project you need to put together or how it works, thats all I do for my opinion but you just gotta find the right one. You should get some good knowledge then bad, because people will have more success, being more intelligent makes you smarter than other people.",1.0
e_xitikkfq,0,"People all over the world use cars to drive to 20 different places in a day. We use so much gas in a week that it's pretty much impossible to imagine what the human population would do if we didn't use cars. Some people are trying hard to limit those numbers and make the roads less for traffic. If we stopped using cars for a while there may be several benefits.

First, by reducing car use there would be less traffic on the roads and no one would be as stressed. With out a car people would have less stress on their back. In a survey made by Robert Duffer, it says that people who do not use automobiles are the least stressed out people in the world. There are so many people in this world and to some not everyone has an automobline for themselves. There are many different ways to get some where. I like to use a bicycle to ride, it is fun and I get to go places. People all over the world should join me and use a bicycle instead of using a car. Some people use bikes to travel to places, and even better they travel to several different places at one time by using a bike.

Second, driving an automobile causes a lot more waste for the environment. By using a vehicle, it has a lot of toxic gases that get blow out of a vehicle. Automobiles also go through a lot of fuel to make it go. That fuel is what is causing damage to the ozone layer. Smog is what occurs when an automobile is not taking action for pollution. In Paris smog is starting to get very bad. If we start doing somthing about smog, it may limit the fuel that we have and the smog on our globe. People may even get better at walking and bikcing by not having automobiles and polluting the earth with fuel.

Third, the amount of cars used to travel back and forward to places has been taking an effect on human growth and development. Instead of being out and about and in touch with nature a lot of people may not be doing any exercising and just going back and forth to places. Cars have made a difference in people in many ways. For some cars may cause stress, and others causes stress and anxiety to other issues. The cars have been a huge part of getting to places and communicating with out the use of a car. By driving a car humans are losing a little out of themselves and not being in touch with how beautiful nature is.

Overall, it is a better idea to use a car not to travel to place when we can walk or ride a bicycle to it. Using cars causes pollution and more stress in a human and to the enviorment. It also causes to people to not being in touch with nature and what was made. By having a car to get to places does not make human stronger because we just got use to not using a car and using other means of transportation.",1.0
e_ermfa1o7,0,"As an American citizen, I am fully aware of the benefits of reducing car usage. In many countries in Europe, car usage has been banned. It's a great way to reduce pollution, and to lower stress levels amongst citizens. I believe that the United States should do such things, in order to benefit our environment as well as our community.

Reducing car usage has many positives. Pollution is a big thing for many countries and cities. In Beijing, china, the smog is so bad that they had to limit car usage for the better of the community. ""Congestion was down 60%in the capital of France,"" stated Robert Duffer. ""Vauban, Germany,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". In Vauban, Germany, they do not allow cars. There are only two main roads and streets all the other streets are carfree. ""The advantages of limited car usage are huge."" Said Carlo Piani. As you can see, limiting car usage has some great advantages, and it can also help out with global warming and the pollution problem.

The advantages of not having cars on the street also benefit your community as well as your own body. Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car, I was tense now, I'm much happier."" I'm not sure what she meant by ""tense"", but I think she meant that it made her stress free. In the United States, cars can cause you to be so stressed out from the traffic, and all of the cars around you. ""In Germany suburbs, where middle class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to live, planners are now forcing a new approach, in which car ownership is allowed but there are only two parks in which to park garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a parking spot for 40,00."" As stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In Germany, they have only two garages where you have to pay for your cars to be parked. I think if the United States could do what they have done in germany, and have only a couple parking lots where the cars can be parked, instead of everyone having a car space in their garage.

In conclusion, many advantages come with reducing car usage all over the world. Not only does it help the earth by lowering pollution and the green house gas effect, but it also can lower your stress levels. It can benefit your community and yourself. I strongly believe that if we, as American citizens, could reduce our car usage, it would greatly benefit the world, and make life so much better and stress free.",1.0
e_4qd2rw2i,2,"6 days had already past but not a day had gone by without someone complaining about some thing. ""Its a natural formation,"" said Jim Garvin.

As you are reading this passage you must be amazed on how much science has gone through in our lives. In 1976 when it happened for the first time, many people questioned it, some believe it was made by a ancient civilzation and others were against it. But there was some science that proved to be right, some were incorrect and wrong about that. Now 34 years after it happened in 1976 and the Mars Global Surveyor team was going through Cydonia where they found the "" Face"", as everyone called it that had appeared in a viking picture and everyone knew it had to do with alien technology. But the Mars Global Surveyor team had already taken the ""Face"" picture 7day photos from different views of Cydonia, where it proved to be a natural landform. The ""Face"" was just a natural land form not made by alien technology. The evidence for this is in text 2 it says this ""But this was not an easy task,"" says Jimmy Garvin. "" Each pixel in the 2001 image, spans by 1.56 meters,"" he added."" ""Compared to 43 meters pixle size of the viking fotograms."" The evidence for why it proves it's natural and is not alien artifact, is it's size and the size matters in this case.

In fact this ""Face"" is just a natural landform, as scientists prove. Scientists proved it when on April 5, a long time before the face showed up, Garvin and others were preparing to look back at Cydonia, the planet where it is located. Garvin and his colleagues used the VVG1 camera to take another picture in 1998 that proves even more how real this natural lard form really is by showing the picture had to be a natural land formation because of all of its features and shadows. And in the article it says "" Each pixel in text 3 it says that "" 44 metres."" "" That's the exact width of airplane wings on an airliner"". Which shows it is a large land formation that would take multiple times trying it out to get it the size of the plane wing on an airplane. Which makes it impossible in 1998 to see that it could of been aliens making a face by making one little hole by it self which makes it impossible. And if it was made by alien technology it would've shown by making one space shuttle, but if we could've seen space shuttles with a camera it most likley wloud've shown it if it had some kind or alien technology. We have seen space technologey on NASA's Mars Orbiter Camera since 1998 the the first shot taken was in 1984, so you can only guess that we'll keep seeing more amazing views of it's natural formation.

The article also provides us some evednece of what happens to the natural landform like in 1916 it said that the natural surface of mars had weather changes such as storms that can break rocks off it causing damage to it. The article also talks about how we don't have to think anythin more and think it's alien technology and not a natural landform, but to think of what can be happening on Mars today that could damage this landmark. Scientists also talk about what we can do. NASA says to keep looking at this form on Mars in it's natural state by keeping cameras out there. If that is the case we could also keep looking, or it could have just been an illusion all along and not an alien landmark because the shadows on the landform look more like a face that was made up of shadows and it really didn't have that shadow look. The shadows that could only prove the face is there or not are in paragraph 7 where it says that you can take pictures and in the paragraph 8 and onward there are pictures, or in paragraphs  5 and 6 we can tell what the landform actually is and if its real or a myth and even if aliens where trying to say there there and making alot of landforms that can also look just like that. In paragraph 19 it proves how it could be made by space tecnology because they say that if it could look and sound like it is human made in the article we could've also seen the alien technology. But with the new science we can keep researching the face and seeing what it really is all the time.",1.0

i think that we should have the election by popular vote because it lets people choose their president and who will represent them based on there voteing for the other person's electors. I think the people should start thinking about who they think should be president, but i also think that it is just a process that takes care of the votes and what happens in the eletoral vote. Also, Electoral college avoids problems like if the wrong dicide has a president and he or she has more elctors in the office than when they could just pick the one they wanted to be president. Electoral college is not a place its a process that it lets people choose who they want in the white house.

e_ez59k7el,1,"Dear State Senator, I do not like the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's basically a winnertakeall system in each state. Especially with California it represents 35 million voters and if they are really close and have a tight margin the winning side of the votes takes it all, which means all the 55 representative votes go for that one side. getting rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the the peoplevoters.

First of all, an example of this could be Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Like almost all cases award electoral votes on a winnertakeall, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. the popular vote was very close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.

Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn't be what the voters want in some cases.

Third, according to the Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the the electoral college has its cons.

Conclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other candidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophy and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winnertakesall.",0.0
e_aqdqj21z,-7,Cars with automatic driving can you believe it? I personally believe driverless cars will be unsafe and unnecessary. There is no reason that we can t drive ourselves. While the car drives itself people still need to be aware of the things sorrounding them in case of an accident. Roadblocks are detected making the human take over on controls. If the person were to not pay attention what could be the outcome? Wrecks fatalities and problems. Say that the person who is in the car pays no attention to the road. Instead heshe is playing on their phone. That causes danger to everyone else in. There is no way to monitor these people without invading privacy. Also laws would need to change in order for these new drivers. Making things harder to adapt to. Not a part of the time. people have the natural ability to drive. There are some upsides to this invention. These new cars take half less gas than a normal taxi. saving money. As stated in the text the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today s taxis. It would also offer more flexibility than a bus states the text. Get this you would not have to pay for a car. There could be a publictransport taxi system that is cheap and affective. In all these cars could cause a major problem. At the moment there is more evidence against the cars than for them. It s cold hard facts. These should not be used we should continue to navigate manually.,0.05
e_5cy5vp8o,4,"My position on driverles car is that I think we should go with what the majority of people want. I believe in my heart that if everyone could have their way, no one would want to drive a selfdriving car and we'll all be driving our own vehicle for years to come. So we might as well just stick to our old ways until there are some major improvements made in the technology side of things and maybe then consider changing it up. The only reason why I say this is because from personal experience, when you get used to something being done one certain way your whole life, it can be hard getting used to doing it another way even if it means not having to do anything at all. It's like how many kids hate change and don't want to switch schools or move to somewhere they aren't familiar with. That's exactly what most people will feel about driverless cars so let's skip straight to improving the techonology first before we worry about the changes happening out on the road.

Another thing I also feel strongly about is that I really wouldn't trust myself in a driverless car. If I was going somewhere very important, like work for example, I certainly wouldn't want to take a chance on whether or not I'm actually going to make it or not. I personally prefer safety over convenience every single time. There have been far too many times where I had a near miss accident while behind the wheel due to someone else making an error, but if that happened in a driverless car, who knows? It could end up costing me my life which is something no one wants to happen.

So overall, I am against selfdriving cars for now until more testing has been done and more research comes out. We still haven't found the right solutions for all of these problems yet. Maybe someday soon we can see new developments for driverless cars.",0.9
e_gxzjkw63,-5,"In his essay, ""SelfReliance,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson posits that individuals must strive to achieve beyond their current abilities in order to experience growth. I concur with Emerson's perspective, as I believe that pushing oneself to learn and explore new things is crucial to personal development and success.

One of the key reasons why I agree with Emerson is that the experiences we accumulate throughout our lives can make us stronger, both mentally and emotionally. When we push ourselves to try new things and take on challenges, we develop resilience and a greater sense of selfconfidence. This, in turn, enables us to tackle even more difficult tasks and achieve our goals.

Furthermore, I believe that it is important to stay focused on our goals and to remain committed to them, even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. By doing so, we can continue to grow and develop, both as individuals and as members of society.

Personally, I have found that pushing myself to learn and explore new things has been a key factor in my own personal growth. Whether it's learning a new language, taking up a new hobby, or pursuing a new career path, I have found that the process of learning and growing has been incredibly rewarding.

In conclusion, I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson that individuals must strive to achieve beyond their current abilities in order to experience growth. By pushing ourselves to learn and explore new things, we can develop resilience, increase our sense of selfconfidence, and continue to grow and develop as individuals and members of society.",1.0

e_33p188ti,-7,"Through the past century mechanization on a global scale has indubitably innovated the world in efficency and economic progress. In particular however the key invention of the car has solely shown the benefits of such techonological progress. For a few innovators the mere invention of cars did not seem convincing enough hence the creation of driverless automobiles has been in design to furtherly increase efficiency and safety. Although the benefits of adopting driverless cars in society seem to and progressing, ultimately the development of driverless cars will only entail disaster. A strong factor contributing to the cons of driverless cars is the undeniable usage of human skills throughout the road even with using driverless cars. Although the term driverless car may seem like a straightforward terminology it is in reality not. Currently there is not the development of a car that completely has the of the car driver. On paragraph 7 it notes None of the cars developed so far are completey driverless. Morever due to the fact that driverless cars cannot function completely by themselves this requires that human passengers still have to be attentive at all times. As stated on paragraph 7 it says cars can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed to take the control when the need to human driving skills. In fact this means the human driver must continue to remain in and the attention to take over the road if the driverless car cannot drive in a certain situation. Despite that driverless cars can permform tasks independently it is only to a limited extent. Therefore this still requires the full attention and driving skill set of the car driver. If this still requires the full attention and driving skills of the car driver the invention of the carless driver in reality has no useful benefits. The driver therefore still has risks of getting into car accidents because they still need to rely on their driving abilities rendering the invention of driverless cars ineffective. The most important factor of all in contributing against the promotion of driverless cars however is the idea of fault. On paragraph 9 a controversial question is brought up asking If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? If a driverless car were to get into an accident and if someone were to be injured as a result who s fault would it ultimately be? This serious and controversial argument as a result creates a prodigious amount of conflict particularly between drivers and manufacturers. Because driverless cars are most of the time indepent of the car drivers an accident caused by this invention will guaranteed cause a difficulty in finding who is truly at fault. On one hand it could have been the driver himself for not paying attention to the road and altering the mechanics of the driverless car. However on the other hand it could have been a completely honest mistake where the driverless car itself commited an automated mistake that did not associate with the actions of the car driver. Driverless cars in conclusion make it difficult to assert the blame on whos truly at fault in a driverless car accident therefore making it extremely more difficult in handling and resolving this situation. Without driverless cars there will only be one to blame and therefore more problems will be resolved. Lastly the existence of traffic laws and working areas in the road is prominent in the the efficency of driverless cars. On paragraph 9 it says Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. In other terms common aspects of the road such as traffic laws and working zones are designed so that only human drivers can handle those situations thus making driverless cars useless. In these terms this means that alert drivers will perform much more reliably than an automated car because the road and traffic laws are set up so that the only safe car is a car where a human driver is in control at all times. Because driverless cars are incapable of handling such pivotal features of the modern road system they must still rely on their human drivers contradicting their own title of driverless cars. In conclusion because the driving laws of the road are mainly designed so that safety will be best achieved with alert human drivers the implementation of driverless cars in modern society is utterly useless. Due to the manifestations of human actionbased safety and continued lack of human driving skills and no longer blame or control in a car situation, the addition of driverless cars into society will only cause increased harm and reduced economic efficiency. The addition of fully driverless cars is currently only fantasy and should remain this way eternally.",0.05
e_utdh7r90,4,"The article ""Driverless Cars"" is about the stance on when and how driverless cars will be made and deploded onto the roads of the United States and elswhere. When I read the article I was fasinated by someparts of the story and not happy about other parts. I believe we shouldn't have driverless cars or have some version where we can turn on and off the driverless mode.

If we have driverless cars I wouldn't buy one because it is so much easier to me in my opinion just to drive it on itself. The reason being is that I don't believe they will be as safe as they say. The reason I say that is because people might want to drive their own cars and people might not like computers controlling their every move. I personally think that since most of the world's population already know how to drive it will just have more deadly accidents. In the story it says ""The combination sof all this input is to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" They don't say it will improve human driving just that it will mimic. So why would we replace something that has worked for a hundred years with something that will work the exact same way and not improve it? I don't get it.

Now I like that we have cars that will be able to make the roads safer with sensors. That's something we can capitilize on, not driverless cars that change nothing except the driver. Tesla will not release a car by 2016 because it is 2016 and I've not heard anything. The technologies not even there for people to drive on highways and it's a big waste of time on all those engineers when they can be making something to make this world better.

e_pxdubs2a,5,"The Facial Action Coding System is a process that has the ability to identify human emotions. The process begins by having the computer constructs a 3D model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans muscles. The Facial Action Coding System will help us learn about students, and others who have many facial expressions on their faces because they are bored or confused. This technology can also be used for people with disabilities so they won't need any communication tools just to express what they want.

This new technolgy would benefit schools becuase it could read how students feel while doing an assignment, when we do math problems sometimes I don't understand them but instead of asking questions from my teacher I would ask myself why am i not getting this right? Or, maybe im really smart in this subject and I should continue learning more things related to math. It would help teachers know if someone doesn't get something wrong or right. If the student gets something correct then the teacher knows heshe needs to give more challenges. For example, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor"". When we get a better understanding or knowledge about things its always good to keep challenging ourselves even though some people might think we aren't ready to handle bigger tasks yet, at least try to see where your potential goes.

It also helps people who struggle talking or communicating with other people around them. Most likely there is no way to show exactly how you feel without saying anything but now we got this amazing tool that allows us to communicate our feelings through actions. For instance, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that too."" It wouldn't hurt to give out a chance to everyone who wants to use the Facial Action Coding System.

In conclusion, this is one of the most helpful invention for everybody. Not only does it help students but it will also help disabled people communicate. There is nothing bad about it helping improve yourself as well as others around you. We are surrounded by different types of technologies everyday but this one is special because it gives people an opportunity to change themselves and make the world less stressful than before.",0.9
e_2ozst4bm,5,"Introduction:

I think that the use of Facial Action Coding System to read emotional expressions of students in the classroom could be valuable. Teachers could use this information to better understand their students and to create a more positive learning environment. For example, if a teacher sees that a student is feeling frustrated, they could adjust their teaching style to help the student learn more effectively.

Argument:

Many people always get confused. Some people say that using the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is brilliant, while others say it is a terrible idea. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about using this new technology. The Facial Action Coding System lets computers see what emotions people are feeling. For instance, if someone is happy, the computer will know they are happy by using this technology. 

The use of the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers to better understand their students. It can help them to identify the emotions that their students are feeling and to address them. This can lead to a more positive classroom environment and better communication between teacher and student.

Conclusion:

Some people say that using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, while others think that it is unnecessary. I believe that it is a valuable tool that can help us to understand our students better.",1.0
e_5f1ndgmk,-3,"Do you think people should ask for advice?. 

 If people are trying to decide on a decision they need help or advice they can also ask people because people can tell you what to do on the ideas they give them. For example, Generic_Name was having trouble picking which theme she wants for her party. But, then, she asked other people and got some ideas. The people who gave her advice said she would think about the theme because then she gets help on picking something that the people thought about. Another reason is when someone wants to buy something and her friend told her it would be boring because he said it looks boring so, when she went to the store to look for the costumers that they liked. That's why i would like people to give advice and give there opinion on something because they want to help someone make an idea. I think asking someones advice can help you out because maybe someone might think of your own ideas, and it might make the idea better then yours. If you just pick one and get some advice then you could make that choice better than what your talking about, but thats okay because its not gonna make sense if you do what everyone else says and you dont know what you have to say. This is one way of asking people for an advice because at least you are having people give their thoughts on what they think is better or bad because you might hear someone elses thoughts or maybe just don't like what people say and its better that people then just have the chance on giving you some help with things or just letting people make there own choice or whats good for there self so it doesnt matter which type of advice you get.",1.0

I read the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and found it very interesting. I wanted to share my thoughts on the matter with you, as a scientist at NASA. I think the Face is just a natural landform, and I have evidence to support my claim.

First, I'll talk about the evidence. The Face has a repeating pattern that is similar to natural features on Earth, such as the Rocky Mountains. It's also possible that the Face is a product of erosion, or a result of wind and water erosion.

Second, I'll talk about what the article says about the Face. According to the article, the Face was discovered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Orbiter is a very sophisticated spacecraft, and it can capture highresolution images of Mars. The Face was seen in pictures from 2006 to 2014.

Third, I'll talk about the implications of the Face. If the Face is just a natural landform, then it doesn't prove that aliens created it. However, it does show that there is more to Mars than we thought. It's possible that we'll find more evidence of aliens someday, and that's exciting!

e_y1l5g35c,1,"The Electoral College is a process that selects the president of the United States. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because, 1 certainty of outcome, 2 swing states, and 3 big states.

First off, there's certainty of outcome. When Obama was running for presidency he had only won 51.7 percent compared to Romney who had 45.6 percent according to source one ""In Defense of the Electroal College: Five reasons to keeop our much maligned method of choosing the President"". This means that if all other things were equal they would have had about 30 more electorals votes than the other canidate. Also when Gore lost the election with 261 vs. 277 to Bush it was the biggest electoral margin since 1968 but still recieved most popular votes ever cast for a presidential candidate. As said in the passage,""Although the winning candidates share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote,the margin generally reduces the pressure and tension from a close election."" Meaning it lessens the pressure and stress of having to wait until everyones votes are counted up. If you abolish the electoral college voters will only focus on swing states and then bigger states. For example, Obama got 97.8% of the electoral vote in Wyoming while getting just 36.3% in Florida which proves that those votes could be replaced without losing anything.

Next, swing states are another reason why we need the Electoral College. Candidates rarely visit small states where they know they don't stand a chance of winning, so instead they spend their time focusing on the swing states like California, Texas, etc. But even though some people think this system isn't fair, these voters may decide who wins the presidentship. Swing states are known to pay closer attention to the campaign knowing that they will get to choose the winner or lose the state and that they want more information on each party before deciding what side they stand on. With the winnertakeall system in each state, the canidates focus on the tossup states and make sure the campaign in them really pays off and helps out.

Lastly, larger states are also very important. These states include places such as Florida, New York, Californa, etc. They have many electors which gives them a lot of clout. It forces the canidates to concentrate their efforts on the tossup states to win over more people. The biggest states give the largest amount of Electoral Votes because they have the most population therefore giving them the most power in voting. Even though the popular vote has been increasing year after year, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in political balance and makes the smaller states feel like they are being represented too.

Overall, the Electoral College is an essential part of selecting our future Presidents and must continue on to help us make decisions.",0.9
e_3n426kdm,-1,"Phones & Driving

Using a cell phone while operating a vehicle of any stature is a bad decision and should be illegal worldwide. Not only is using a cell phone while driving irresponsible, it's also dangerous to yourself, as well as others on the road. If one does choose to talk, text, or even try and use their cellular device while driving should be penalized to an extent and given a heavy warning. Though a warning, ticket, or even time served may be all it takes to prevent potentially fatal accidents on the road, these methods don't always work. Therefore we, as citizens, and as drivers, should be careful and wise with our decisions.

Reasons why driving and using your cell phone is so dangerous spans on and on. Firstly, one's not fully capable of providing one hundred percent of their attention to a single task such as driving while using their phone. Due to this, using your phone while driving only widens the window for a potential wreck, whether fatal or not. Studies show that using a cell phone and driving has become one of the top leading causes of car crashes in the past twenty years. Secondly, when one is distracted on the road, they put people in danger without even realizing it. There have been many instances where someone who is using their phone, ends up tailgating the vehicle ahead of them, with that vehicle potentially having an entire family in it. Many fatal crashes have been caused by this very action, injuring or even killing those involved in the wreck simply because someone wants to talk, text, or look at social media. So please, if you're driving, try and restrain from using your cell phone until you are parked in a secure location.

Not only is there a wide range of dangers when using your phone and driving, there's also a long list of punishments that follow close behind. One of the main punishments for driving and using your phone is a fine. These fines can range anywhere from 150 to 500 or more depending on how many offenses you have. With such pricey fines, you'd think one would think twice before using their phone while operating a vehicle, but this isn't always the case. To counter this, those who repeat such actions can have their driver's license suspended for up to 90 days. Washington was the first to ban texting and driving statewide with 38 other states following soon after. Some fines received in these states range from the minimum of 20 to a maximum of 10,000 and one year in prison. The average fine being around 150 to 375 in a handful of states. Insurance is another issue when it comes to using your phone while driving, with the coverage cost on your vehicle being affected. You see, the more of a risk you are on the road, the more you must pay on your insurance, so please drive safely.

Those who aren't fond of dangerous drivers should know how to avoid them and stay out of harm's way. One smart and helpful way to steer clear of those pesky drivers is to alert authorities. If you can, it's smart to try and obtain enough information about the driver and their vehicle such as a description of the driver or license plate. Calling 911 can be what saves you or someone else on the road from a potential accident. Another good way to prevent potential accidents is to travel when traffic is at its lowest. Driving in the early hours of the day can be a good time to drive, as well as work hours just before the lunchrush. One would want to limit the amount of traffic on the road as much as possible in order to decrease the possibility of encountering dangerous drivers. Lastly, one simply needs to stay on high alert when driving. It seems like a nobrainer, yet many tend to not follow this basic rule of driving. Pay attention to details such as the speed you and those around you are going. Conditions on the road are also important, such as rain, snow, and ice. Remember that simply paying attention to the smaller details can prevent accidents on the road.

Whether or not you believe using your phone while operating a vehicle is as dangerous as it's portrayed to be, one cannot deny that it is a potential hazard. Many car crashes have occurred whilst using a phone and has become one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. Not only is it dangerous, but it is also illegal in most states and one could also be fined a hefty amount. It's simply a bad idea to text, talk, and overall use your phone while driving. Many tend to put responsible drivers in danger through these acts and fail to realize it until it's too late. Remember to drive responsibly, paying attention to those around you and how you drive. Your phone is not worth a life.",0.0

Now if I told you that the Seagoing Cowboys program was all fun and games I would be lying. There is a lot of work to do. One time I fell down a slippery ladder. I didn t die because if I did I couldn t have wrote this. but I did get hurt badly and I cracked my ribs. There are many responsibilities while on board. I had to work with animals. I had to load and unload them off the ship. Also on my second trip I had the night boat.. job was to take the the animals every hour. Even though there is is work to be done the Seagoing Cowboys program was a great opritunity for me and it could also be a great opritunity for you. Helping out at my aunt PROPER_NAME s farm prepared me and maybe you have some preperation too. This trip taught me more than i could have ever learned at home. The Seagoing Cowboys program really opened my eyes. I hope I go again and I hope I see you there.",0.05

e_wptakm7k,-1,"Dear Principal,

The new policy of not allowing students to participate in sports unless they have a B average is outrageous. It should be the student's choice whether or not he or she wants to play sports. Some people might say it will encourage kids to do better but that isn't always true. Most likely many of them won't even care and still keep their C grade average. They would probably just give up on trying any harder because their sport was taken away from them. Even though some may think its a good idea there are so many more cons than pros. The only way this could work is if you were to give out warnings before taking the privilege of playing away from them. Then again if you tried that nobody knows what kind of reactions you would get. I don't know about others but i personally wouldn't take that well at all. If anything it would make me try harder but then again some people aren't like me. So the best thing you can do is let your kids decide how much they want to learn. As long as they pass with a D or higher that should really be enough. Maybe instead of giving them warnings or threatening to take something away, give them incentives such as prizes or rewards when they make high grades. You never know, maybe it'll inspire some kids who hate school to start doing things right. That being said please consider my opinion and look into changing the new rule back to the old one. Thank you for reading.",0.9

One reason is that your county needs your help there were lots of soldiers dying. Your homeland will be thankful for doing this. And maybe you could meet people and animals that you have never seen or talked about, and see countries.

And lastly being an Seagoing Cowboy is fun. While I was on my trip to China there they feeded me on board the boat and got lots of rest. On trips you play games like volleyball, and I did fencing with my friend, also on my time at home i just hungout with the guys and went to the movies or played baseball with them. Being part of this is fun and a good way to get to travel around the world. I recommend going out side and enjoying time that you can't usually at home.

These are the reasons I recommend you to become a seagoing cowboy in need for these people because most are all gone or died. you could meet animal like a dolphin and a whale. That could make u wanna sign up to be a sea going cowboy.",1.0

These contions are far more extreme than anything humas encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottesr suface temperature of any planet in our solar sytem. Venusian geology and weather present aditional impediments like erupting volcanes. Venus was prebably covered lagerly with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientidts to float above the fray. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exeed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivble for humans. Peering at Venus from shipnorbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from distance. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubs but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0.0
e_03ceevmi,6,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becasue people are intrested in how the solar system works today. Venus can be very intresting if it's something you like to learn about. As the Article says ""On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experience on our own planet."" Knowing we couldn't go there maybe people lose intrest in the planet, but there's a lot more to learn about it. There are some positive things about the planet that you might know or maybe you could learn. Venus is one of the hottest plantes we haveand it could be very dangrous, but it also has some futures just like earth does.

Venus is the second planet from the sun and knowing that it's so close must mean that it really is hot. But also, as i have said it's really simmular to Earth. As is says in the article ""It may have well been the most Earthlike planet."" Also they have said that Venus has some feature that are just like earth ""The planet has a suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features like valleys, moutains, and craters."" Knowing a little about Venus you have so much more to learn.

If your looking a Venus from a far because you can't go on it, and neither could the spaceships...you can't really get a good look at the ground or the planet itself. So there may be something else that's intresting about venus that we don't know yet. As I have read in the text it was saying that NASA is working on new ways to study venus. NASA has always found a way to create something that will last on the planets that we want to explore. Venus is intrestiong because it so hot even some of the objects they want to use they can't.

Reading about venus I have learned a lot, like venus is one of the brightestv points in the sky and when it gets dark you coould see it. Something new as the article says they are trying to figure out whats strong enough to last in venus's conditions. Today they use powerful computers, as it says in the article ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick.""

e_q5a8kqi6,-5,"Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay:

Choosing Our Own Character Traits

As an 8th grader, I think it's super important to choose our own character traits. Like, why should we let society or our parents decide how we should be? We're the ones who have to live with these traits for the rest of our lives, so we should get to pick them!

One reason why we should choose our own character traits is because it helps us figure out who we really are. Like, if we're always trying to be someone we're not, it can be really hard to figure out what we like and what we don't like. But if we get to choose our own traits, we can be more confident in who we are. Plus, it's way more fun to be yourself than to try to be someone else!

Another reason why choosing our own character traits is important is because it affects how we dress and interact with others. Like, if we're trying to be someone we're not, we might dress in a way that's not really us, or act in a way that's not genuine. But if we get to choose our own traits, we can dress and act in a way that's true to who we are, and that makes it way easier to connect with others.

For example, my friend Sarah used to try to be really outgoing and popular, but she found out that it was really hard to keep up with all the fake smiling and pretending to be interested in things she didn't really care about. So now she's embraced her introverted side and started being more genuine with her friends, and she's way happier!

Some people might say that having a good character requires special skills, like being able to always be kind and patient, but I think it's more about being true to yourself. Like, if you're always trying to be someone you're not, it can be really hard to be kind and patient, because you're not really being yourself. But if you're being true to yourself, it's way easier to be kind and patient, because you're not trying to be someone you're not.",1.0
e_0w07ozd6,1,"It'd be better to stay with the Elecotral colleg because there's a strong number of people voting for our presidents. One vote will just mean one vote and we have to keep all votes for our president at an equal rate to decide on a person with out many other facts. If there's other facts in what you decide by votes, then it's not as fair or just as that person wouldn't know in what was said on the campaign or it might of said wrong then in the articles. It should remain at who has most of the voters in a campain because in the article the author say if you go by most votes and no majority votes its basically telling the candidates what we're suppose to make a camping out of or if they didn't pay any mind then that would of went in any body's favor that campaign was made for like in Florida because there is more people in texas or more peoples then there are in ohio but how could be able to control the states then people would go with the majority because like saying with 43 percent you want to go with who have the major or is a campaign just like that because there could be so many issues when it comes to having to decide not from the state you are going in. If we don't decide in who gets president we could never go along and we get a bad president or a president who may just think about what he wants. And if thats what we get its not only us voting but every states and there is at least 3,374,275 votes who vote to get who ever is there. As of right now its better to go with majority vote because some president campaigns are so strong but not fair then that doesn't mean a election goes to one and you can not control who your voters. In paris everyone from one state goes to that president who has major to get his people to vote for him but in ours not many people would agree to that and not many people know who can really stand up. People may be biased to a campaign and vote and think we voted for the president but it may in not the one that you went for because thats what campaigns are, if it happens with that election then not much more would ever happen anymore then a majority vote that goes at a certain rate of voting that doesn't change. In many states there may only be few votes that people actually get in a camaign that may decide one thing when they thought they'd be another. We need voters to get things done. It say in one of the articles that votes by state vote and the winner takes it all so lets vote at rate of 250 is just an over rated idea and not very likely it's just what the majority of people wants are not in the way of what the majority wants.",1.0
e_m8ed63kl,-1,"Dear principal,

I respect your wishes to make a new rule stating that students' may not participate in school activities and sports, if they can not keep their average of a B. I agree with you, I feel this way because that would be motivation for the students' to keep their grades up, so they can participate in activities and sports. The shy children who don't understand the text, might be more willing to raise their hand and ask for help, so they can do those kind of things. And I think that the students' test scores would improve very much. Children love it when the school has activities that they can attend. Its what keeps them more willing to go to school every morning. So i suggest that the principal do change the school policy. Some students' may not like this idea at all, but they will eventually get over it because they want to attend the activities, and be on the sport's team. You have my opinion , which states that it would be a wonderful move for the school if they do this.",0.0
e_rlwtg7an,-1,"Dear Principle,

I have heard you want to change the policy on grades and sports. I think that it is a great idea because if they are not making good grades then why should we let them play?

Therefore i am writing this letter to tell you my opinion about what your doing. You will be changing many peoples lives by just stopping people from playing without having the correct grade point average.

If you do change the policy more kids in school would try harder to get better grades.

By you changing the policy students may actually start liking school. By this happening there will be less drop outs of high schools. The parents might also like the fact that their child has a higher GPA than before the rule was changed. This could help us out greatly in the future with smart students graduating our high schools. Also another thing that can happen when you make this decision is that maybe some students who never thought about going to college now can go. When these student decide to go to collage after graduation, they most likely wouldn't have been able too if you didn't change the policy.

So as you can see there are many benefits from changing this rule.

That is why i believe that you must change the policy so kids can learn how important education really is. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this letter.",0.9
e_iyifkjd7,-3,"The prompt said ""I think that being honest with others is good. Because it show how you really are in life."". 

 I'm not saying this is a good thing to be honest sometimes. But it could be good because you can help other if they need it and you could get good grades and get out of trouble of being dishonest, and it shows you that you care about someone even tho you dont feel right. You can make people trust you and trust your decision when you tell them the truth, but I think not, because I am not the kind of person who cares for me. I don't think i am entrustful because, I can be lying in public, at work, in my job and at home. In school they always lie and they never tell me what's going on in school that can change things in the future. When you talk about other people around the world, what you do and how your going to do?. If you lie an someone else, the chances are that they might say what happened to them when they told them. They might ask you to say it, that could work out but you always want to stay honest and tell people what really happened. A lot of people might tell you something wrong,but you never know. That is how it goes. Another example is when I first moved to the United States I remember that I was really sick at that time and I tell my mother I felt really bad. It feels really good to talk to someone about the things that happen around me, like when my friend tells me that my aunt told me to tell her she was sick and we were having problems, we would be happy because we could do more than just talking about our stuff. There was the time I thought it was gonna go way better but she said I did the right things I told her. We would have been doing better to not tell anyone. People will always remember what we have done in our life for the better. Doing all of that and not lying because no one wants to feel alone and be with you, not with someone. This is what honesty means, it makes you feel better with yourself knowing people know you are not doing your job, or your friends. Getting an appointment for work are the best way to start with your day because it gives you more opportunities of working with more people. For example, there is one guy who works and his whole life he has to work everyday to get an assignment. Some people are lying all day long for an interview. Also, some people may say ""No"" but the one who is not telling the suppose thing about you but, they are wrong. Sometimes, you have to think about it so, how could you be there? Its hard for most people to find someone whos not honest because of all the stress they have. Most people would say to him they can do whatever they want because they know that everyone has different way of thinking and putting your own feelings first.",1.0
e_kygesw1u,6,"In the articl ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus despite the dangers that it has to offer. Venus is one of many planets in our solar syatem that has features very similar to those on Earth. Although Venus is one of Earths closes neighbor it also proves challenging to study despite their similarities. Despite the challenges that Venus presents to humans studying Venus is worthy because of it's close similarities to Earth, and it's possible future living space.

Although Venus has a surface of about 97% rocky terrain including valleys, mountains, and crates, it still has many features that we find here on planet Earth. Venous has features like valley and ridge mountains similar to those here. Scientists have said that these features suggest that Venous may have once held ocean and other forms of life similar that we find here on Earth. Another thing they have said about Venus is that it could once have looked alot like Earth. In 2001 Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter camera took photographs of the Venusian landscap. ""The images and 3D alti meter maps that were taken of venus's rochly surfrage."" These features were very familiar, like Earth's. So with all those features in common how could Venus be so inhospitable. It could not be. ""A thick atmophsphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets the planet. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulforic acid in Vnenous atmeperhore."" Venous surface temperature averages over 300 degrees Celsius. The atmospheric pressure would compress us into liquid and destroy us because we wouldn'd survive the harshness of this climate for a second. In a planet of so harshness there has to have been something on that is able to survive.

Venus was probably able to have life on it in its far in its past history. If there is no more life on Venus then humans can take up a new habita there. With its harsh climate, no living things, and dangerous terrain it seems like there shouldn't be anything to support life. ""Some simplified electronis made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface. These systems can work in such condition and are made from materials that can withstand pressures to three times greater than those we experience here on Earth. The electronics have a durable, mechanical part made to be much tougher than electronics in our world today. They have lasted a couple days in this harsh atmosphere of Venous and would most likley continue to support us on its harsh terrain even longer if there are changes or improvements that would allow that."" If we were capable of finding some type of electronic that can survive on Venus, what else do they think could? With such harsh terrain that can be survived by the machines what could they create to hold humans. We have been able to come up with electronics to survive such dangrous environments. Why not us. The authors of the article state ""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limted to a place were there is nothing but hostility.""
tell us why should there be hostility in Venusa when we are already living with such danger here. ""These improvements would not only help humans live on Venusa it would probably allow the electronics to last much longer and work longer on its challenging surface."" If the electronics that have been improved to survive Venus's envirments were so durable then what else can withstand such harsh conditions if we can? ""Imagine that solar power systems and mechanical computers were first envisioneed."" These machines could be improved with our own inventions and technologies we use now to survive the harsh envirnaments here.",1.0

e_cce7pypt,5,"Have you ever thought about how a computer can read your emotions? It may sound very interesting, but would it be useful in the classroom. In an article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto he explains how a new software has been created that helps recognize peoples facial expressions. The author suggests this could be used to help improve students emotional and physical health while they are in class. I think using technology like FACS, Facical Action Coding System, is not valuable in the classroom because there are other ways of dealing with these problems such as a counselor or teacher, the technology is too expensive for most schools, and lastly it will take away from teaching time.

The first reason why i disagree with the authors idea of adding this system into our school systems is because their are already other programs in place for helping people who need some extra support. A lot of schools have a school counselor available if you need someone to talk to when something is bothering you. Also, if you feel as though you are getting bullied teachers can step in and stop that before anything else happens. Lastly, If you do not enjoy a subject at all, then you can get paired up with another student or even your parents can meet with your teachers and see what needs improvement. All those reasons prove my point that we should leave things alone since everything that needs attention is already taken care of without having to add more money onto our school budgets.

My second reason to oppose this is because many schools cannot afford this technology so therefore they wont receive any benefits from it. In paragraph 12 of the passage the author states,""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad."" This statement right here tells us that this product costs thousands upon thousands of dollars which means only bigger city schools can purchase them. So now only big cities will be able to know exactly when one of their students feels down or upset. This also proves that everyone is equal no matter where you come from, so we don't want certain areas to start receiving better treatment than others just because they were able to buy a machine that helps analyze faces.

Lastly, this technology doesnt seem to benefit anyone except maybe the company producing it. Most likely it was made to make more money off of the fact people find it intriguing. As stated in paragragh 6,""A classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Even tho that sounds great, it really isn't. Teachers dont need computers telling them when their students are confused or bored because thats what the job is supposed to entail. They need to teach in a way that makes everybody understand material without needing to use a machine. Also, the text says,""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor"", this just seems unnecessary especially if we already have qualified teachers. Not everyone learns the same way or likes being taught the same thing everyday. Some students prefer learning on paper rather than doing work on a laptop or tablet so there really is no sense in spending lots of money on something that probably wont even be utilized correctly anyway.

In conclusion, FACS does not belong in the classroom due to its high cost, uselessness, and the amount of resources we already have to deal with situations similar to this one. Technology is great but sometimes it takes over. We must remember we still live in an era where books exist instead of a screen. Just because a device can do something doesn't mean it always should. In my opinion, we should stick to old fashioned methods of communication instead of trying to become robots.",0.9
e_cwqygzaa,0,"Automobile ownership has been the hallmark of the suburban life for quite a considerable period of time. Since the World War II, suburb development projects in the West had cars in mind in every single design. This resulted in the car intensive suburban landscape. This phenomenon is now seen across the globe and in places like Chinese sprawling metropolitan areas, and its effects are felt not just by drivers and families but by the planet. Greenhouse gas, which comes primarily from cars is a growing concern, not just for Americans but globally.
Nowadays, cities all over Europe, America, and even the Philippines, such as Vauban, are reconsidering and innovating suburban life to become less reliant on private vehicles, with the movement of smart planning, says a writer of The NY Times, Elizabeth Rosenthal, in an article called German Suburb Live WO Cars. These new planning initiatives focus mainly on two primary objectives  reducing dependence on cars to address the problems of greenhouse gas production, and creating a compact suburb, where shops and facilities like hospitals and schools are accessible through public transit and walking distance.
To put a stop to the problem of gas emissions, European suburb dwellers are encouraged to change lifestyles that have become reliant and interdependent to automobile ownership, which is no different than how we are living in most of our American counterpart cities or other cities in the globe, and instead adopt a life of more conscious transportation. An article from The NY Times tells the readers about the residents of a German suburban development, called Vauban, who did exactly this  by living in their homes without cars in this carfree district, which is on the edge of Freiburg. Residential street parking and the usage of home driveway are outlawed and the home garages are only located in a community garage, for a price of around 40,015 each parking slot along with a house. Rosenthal noted that the families in Vauban were not required by law to sell their cars when the community was completed in 2006. But, in 57% cases of families that lived in the carfree streets and the children that play without constant fear from automobile, the car ownership became irrelevant for a comfortable suburban lifestyle.  The people who walked the Vauban streets, which swarm with the sounds of cycling people, and children wandering about on the sidewalk, and the chitterchatter among the locals as opposed to the sound and the presence of passing cars and its noisy hum, found them more contented and much more relaxed to be car free.
The Vaubans way of life has not been just restricted to a few residents and streets of the city. As the writer Elizabeth Rosenthal said, Vauban is just a piece of this trend called smart planning, and its basic principle is becoming adopted all over America and the globe in attempts for a more pedestrianfocused design, as we move the commercial areas in a walk away position in a primary main street instead of being far in distant and crowded highways and places which make the people walk or be forced by the circumstances and design of life, to own a car just because these shopping areas are so difficult and troublesome to go to on foot or through other means.",1.0

The Face is located on a mountainside in the Martian desert, and is made up of dirt, rocks, and ice. It is only about 1.5 miles long, which is very small compared to other mountains on Mars. The Face also has very few geological features, which is strange for a mountain.

Another piece of evidence that proves that the Face is a natural landform is its location. The Face is located near a series of canyons called the Valles Marineris. This location is significant because the Valles Marineris is the largest canyon in the solar system, and the Face is very small in comparison.",1.0
e_159gu9zz,6,"Many reasons why we should learn more about venus would be useful in many ways one of them being the long ago history of planets. There would be more things learned about planets that are simular to us, such as history or how we might be able to survie on Venus a long time ago. Scientists can figure out if the planet is too much similar or similar to the one we are researching.

When researching Venus there would be something gained as to why we should keep exploring the planets similar to Earth such as the history of Venus. Stated in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" scientists are researching another way to find more information on Venus that we may not have ever seen before. If we do then we wont have as much data as Earth does. Also scientist can learn about other planets that may be similar to them as well and what to avoid. We could learn how to make it less dangerous to be on our own planet.

Getting a stronger drone would teach us about what not to do when we are not sure about something or something that we don't know about. Another reason would be to learn how to go to Venus and other planets that might have been similar to them so we could learn more about another planet that was just like Earth and could be very useful when figuring out other options to help them get closer to that planet.

The last reason to explore Venus is that it is safe ways to find a way to stay near or close to the planet.",0.7

If it is a driverless car shouldnt the driver not have to be alert? if the driver still has to be awear of all the suroundings then is there realy a point in having a car that drives its self, but can not preforn simple tasks like pulling in and out of a drive way paragraph two.

Also lets take into acount how many people may think that its okay now that there are cars that drive their selfs that they can get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. What about a case where a person falls asleep because they are getting bored waiting on the car to tell them its their turn to drive.paragraph Eight

Some people will not wake up to alarm clocks let alone their car telling them that it needs help. Texting and driving no doubt will get worse the driver may think the car can handel it for one more text, but it couldnt.

With how the draving laws change are we going to have to spend more money to get our cars to download the new laws and even then will we really be safe? Will the driving age change now that knowing how to drive is not really needed?

Yes the cars have sensors and GPS and cameras but even people have missed seeing a Deer, Racoon, and in some cases even people. Also how is a car going to know the difference between a person daydreaming and one that is alert? What if the car notifies you too late that they dont know what they are doing? Will you be left with all the blame? papragraph 9 last sentance Yes its an intresting concept but not intirely safe.",0.0
e_aq9ym4d2,4,"My opinion on driverless cars is that they can be a huge help but then again they could cause problems.

I think driverless cars can be beneficial because they could help do things a lot faster and help a lot with other things. It has some good things like warning you, helping with gas mileage, and driving itself. You really don't have to drive, you just sit and let the car take you by itself.

I think it can cause problems because it won't use a lot of gas and if you don't need gas, no one will make any money because you won't need all of it and there will be a lot of gas in the ground because no one is bringing it up because no one needs it to make gas because driverless cars don't need a lot of gas. It will create problems because if you don't have to drive, the car will drive for you and if the car is driving for you and all you do is sit, you will forget how to drive and if something happens and you need to take over, you will not know because you forgot how to drive because you relied on the car to drive itself.

My thoughts on driverless cars can be both positive and negative. I think more on the negative because many people will not have jobs if you don't have to drive because you rely on the car to drive for you. So I think it can be a good thing that we have driverless cars but at the same time, it can be a negative thing too.",0.9
e_ld2f68r0,1,"I think that when picking the president that the people of the United States should be the ones to pick instead the electoral college makes the choices of whom we get for president. When you vote along with everyone else I think that the majority of the votes should get that president instead of everyone voting and then it's getting sent to the electoral college and them getting to pick who they want with i don't think is right I think that the people should pick who they want by the votes. The one with the most popular vote should win. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for slate of electors. The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. If you were running for president and you didn't have as many votes from the people as the after guy you can still win the election cause of the electoral college is the one that makes the decision to whom we have as the president.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not wing the national popular vote. This is a very rare thing to happen it has only ever happen twice it happen in 2000 and 1888. People think that they should abolish the electoral college because they think it is not right that they get to vote for who actually becomes president they think it should be the citizens right to pick who we want as president rather than letting the electoral college vote for us for president. In Columbia they are allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. In conclusion I think that it is not right that the electoral college gets to pick are president for us but I think that we should be able to pick are president by popular vote instead of having that electoral college.",0.0
e_xdl3loq6,-2,"Aisir awoke inside the ruins of the ship. He began to move, only to halt at the sharp stabbing sensations emanating from his side. It hurt to breathe somewhat. He tried to move his limbs, only to realize they too had become immobile.
""Curse it all..."" He groaned to himself, as he began tugging at the harness. Eventually after some brute force, the restraints snapped loose. Aisir leaned far enough right to topple into the floor. The emergency lights lit the way to the exit. But for the time being, all Aisir could think of was the pain.
""Lieutenant Aisir...What is your status? Lieutenant, do you read?""
""Yeah, Bertha'll, I read."" Aisir squeezed out between gasps as he laid on the floor of the craft.""
""What is your status? Our scanners have lost your craft. Please report status...""
""Status..."" Aisir forgot for a moment. Clawing his way to the bulkhead, he realized how badly wounded he actually was. The gash protruding from his side had cause him to lose a considerable amount of fluid. He could see the pinkish trail as he rolled to his left for a brief moment.
""Lieutenant?"" The voice reminded him.
""Ship is down."" Aisir breathed overcoming his nausea, ""Repeat ship down...On surface of planet C130B97, planet under observation...Respond Bertha'll.""
""C130B97, or as inhabitant species dubbed Earth. Correct lieutenant?""
""Confirmed Bertha'll...Contact leadership of Quadrant, erggh, ASAP.""
""Maintain communication..."" Aisir continued crawling toward the emergency release hatch as the call connected itself over the next minute.
""Captain De'Xor responding. Report status lieutenant.""
""Sir..."" Aisir panted, ""Ship has been shot down. Contact made. Life support destroyed...They have weaponry, sir. Weaponry, we did not anticipate.""
""Impossible."" The captain replied, ""Our studies showed that the beings prefer war between themselves, lieutenant. Why would they have antiship capability?""
""I don't know how, but they do."" Aisir said as he pulled himself some more. ""They've apparently expected such a thing to occur. Scouting this planet was a mistake, sir.""
""Pull yourself together!"" The captain commanded. Aisir breathed more to calm himself as he listened. ""You are Lieutenant Aisir, Bertha'll base personnel of the Andromeda Federation. Stand strong!""
""I'm standing the best I can, sir."" Aisir explained, as he gripped the release lever. The hatch exploded off, causing him to be blinded by the light. Aisir toppled out of the craft. Landing on the ground two yards below did not help his injuries. He felt something crack, and became rather feint. Lying prone again he glanced at his surroundings.
""Activate, video transmission."" Aisir said as the device activated.

Captain De'Xor demanded the operators to open the feed. They were greeted a view of the ground, followed by Aisir's arms as he made his way to the top of the shallow crater. Rolling again, Aisir faced what appeared to be a path of some sort, made of black material. A yellow line streaking the center led to confusion of what the surface meant amongst the crowd. De'Xor gestured for silence.
""Oh...Oh...Curse it all."" Aisir groaned, ""Bertha'll come in...Do you have the feed?""
""We do lieutenant."" De'Xor replied.
""You shouldn't...you shouldn't..."" Aisir continued, the feed turning towards the horizon green fields, buildings and a bright, blue sky, stretched away from him.
""By the Council...It's...It's beautiful...I've never seen anything like it...""
""Respond Aisir."" De'Xor asked quietly.
""Never come here."" He pleaded, ""Please. Never come here...Tell my child, I'm sorry...Captain, please, tell my child.  Tell my family I'm sorry....""
""Lieutenant,"" De'Xor responded ""I command you""
He paused as they listened for a moment. Something had arrived nearby. A ship perhaps? The crowd shrieked as the camera rolled over to face the sky, and a masked being aiming what appeared to be a large photon at what would be Aisir's face. They listened as Aisir gasped hard for air, his lungs taking it in as much as possible. Then he became still. Eventually, another being stepped into view. This one wore all black, and was less heavily armed. Eventually he motioned for the armored one to lower his weapon.
""He's gone."" The being stated, ""Sit rep. Secure the area. Call in Biological for extract.""
""Sir, yes sir."" The armored being replied.

e_1b6rmcvu,4,"Technological innovations have completely transformed the way that people work, communicate, and shop. From the smartphone to selfdriving cars, technology has rapidly developed and expanded our capabilities and spatial reach. Technology allows us to stay connected with friends and family, no matter how far they are away. Online shopping has allowed people to purchase virtually anything all from the comfort of their home. 

Technology has also enabled people to be more efficient in their tasks and activities. Automation has made it possible to do mundane tasks in a fraction of the time as before. It is also opening up opportunities to learn new skills in realtime that would have otherwise required formal education. Technology can provide rapid access to resources, information, and the latest news in an instant.

However, there are some potential negative impacts of technology that should be taken into consideration. Excessive usage can lead to addiction, where users are unable to switch off or take necessary breaks. Information overload can lead to information fatigue, and lack of physical exercise as a result of device usage is known to have hazardous effects on our health. 

Overall, technology and science have been responsible for a number of beneficial advances in our society. However, when used in excess and with little selfcontrol it can have a negative influence on our lives. As technology continues to evolve and progress, it is imperative to consider the consequences of its use, and to ensure it is used responsibly and in the right context.",1.0
e_03rxug2n,-1,"I do not think that every student should have to participate in at least one after school activity. I say this because, the students might be busy and they cant make time for an after school activity, some of the students already have a plan on what they are going to do after school so if they get put into something without their consent it may disrupt them, and lastly they could be too tired from all the work they did during the day. If none of those things happn then maybe i would change my mind but until that happens these reasons will stay as my reasoning why we shouldn't have everyone join in on the fun.

Some people can be really busy with many different tasks. They could go home and have to clean up around the house, or even worse they could have chores waiting outside. It is also possible that they don't like any of the clubs offered therefor making it harder for them to pick a club. Another thing that could be preventing them from joining is that they need help with homework and dont want to miss out on getting that much needed help. Also they could just sraight up have other stuff to do such as working, doing errands, etc. There is no way you can force someone who needs to take care of their family to come and do an extra activity when they know they will be missig out on something important. All of these examples are showing us how busy some people might be and why it isn't fair forcing them into participating.

Sometimes, a person has a plan on where heshe wants to be after school and doesnt want anything interfering with them. For example they could have plans with friends and family members and if they missed that chance they wont be able to see eachother again untill later dates. Other times they could be attending a special event which would iclude sports games, concerts, award ceremonies, etc. One more reason why i am saying this is that they might simply prefer to rest or relax once they got back home after being at school for hours. The botom line is that they shouldnt be forced into staying longer than necessary especiallywhen its against their wishes.

Finally, some kids are just plain tired after spending 7 long hours at school learning about subjects they dont enjoy or are having trouble understanding. As soon as they walk through the doors of their homes they instantly crash onto the couch and sleep until dinner is ready and they eat before bedtime and wake up the next morning feeling refreshed. Some of the kids however, cannot afford to do that because they dont have anyone to watch over them while they are asleep, thus leaving them with no choice but to stay awake and try to function off of little amounts of energy. With the addition of another hour of doing work or playing sports most likely wont allow them to get enough rest to keep moving forward. So instead of trying to squeeze in an activity they can only focus on getting enough sleep, food, and hygiene done by a certain amount of time.

In conclusion, i believe that nobody should be forced into doing an after schoolactivity. They could be too busy,have existingplans,or even be too tired to hanle anything else. Those were the reasons why i said that people shouldn'thave to do it unless they wish to.",0.9
e_0tf9clmx,-1,"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should not allow students to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times. One of the reasons I think this is because if we are allowed to have our phone out during these time periods it will just cause distractions in classrooms. We could be texting or using them in some way and then when a teacher asks for our attention we won't respond right away causing us to miss information. If students were allowed to bring their cellular devices to school they would only get more distracted by them than what they already do now. Another reason why i don't agree with allowing kids to use their cell phones during free time at school is because many of us who own one would rather talk on them instead of talking face to face with each other. There are also those who don't even need to communicate with someone else through text messages. They can take pictures, record videos, listen to music, play games, etc. Instead of doing work which would help us learn things better so that we wouldn't have to spend extra hours studying it later on. These things aren't bad but there is such thing as being too addicted to technology. It might seem fun to text your friends or family members all day long while sitting around with nothing to do but really all your going to end up getting from it is lazy behavior. You would probably feel like you couldn't focus very well on homework or any assignments given to you. That's another reason why we shouldn't be able to use our cell phones at school. The last reason why we shouldn't be aloud to have them is because kids always lose stuff. You never know how much money we put into these gadgets. What would happen if you lost yours? Wouldn't you want to have it back? Well the same goes for everyone else. Maybe one kid takes his friends phone without her knowing it or maybe somebody steals hers right off her desk or table. Either way you should consider my opinion about this matter. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope you make the best choice for our school based off of what you took into consideration.",0.9
e_h4xrwupl,2,"Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face, but shadows can alter thing appearances. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976, which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one's appearance.

First off, the Face on the isn't a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shows that made it look like face. People and images can come about blurry, and may looklike something else. Also, pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compassion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""10. There is comparison teach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an Aileen artifact.

Next, on April 5th, 1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture, because people keeping it was made by aliens, it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though, it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it, ""Micheal Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera MOC team snapped a picture TNE times sharper than the original Viking photos""7. After that it was on the web people realized that it is a landform not an alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.

Finally, On April 8th, 2001, people still were believing that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view""10. This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.

My opponent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could have had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn't have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.

In conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also, there are not editing system that were perfect to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.",0.0
e_k5lqqkmr,4,"In the article ""Driveless Cars are Coming"" i believe that it is a positive thing because, they have been working on them for 30 years. They could make more money from them and there will be less traffic jams if we do get drivess cars. In this passage they say that Google has had driveless cars since 2016 but they still need drivers in certain situations. So far they can drive up to 50 mph by themselves but the driver needs to stay alert at all times so she or he can take control of the car when ever its needed. The google cars have driven half million miles without crashing. Some manufacturers are trying to put displays onto the windshields so they can show information like work zones and accidents ahead. I think thats a good idea because then you would know whats going on around your car before it happens. They are not sure yet how much these cars should cost. But they might be able to save money with less gas usage per year. These cars use half as much fuel as todays taxis and give better rides than buses.

e_40zm1su0,1,"I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the election of the president of the United States. Over sixty percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. I believe this change would make electing a president much more simple. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. This is because of the winnertakeall system in each state. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

Most counterclaims to my explanation is swing states. This is because voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the outcome of the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Keeping electoral colleges would help in this case, so the candidates have to make both want to vote for them Electoral College and tossup states. Keeping Electoral Colleges also restores some of the weight in the politicaal balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution.

In conclusion, I think the electoral college should be abolished. By doing this, we could avoid electoral ties, and the ""disaster factor''. We can also be more fair and rational to voters. These are the reasons I would like abolish the Electoral college.",0.0
e_dz04y1xb,-3,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything.

My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by himherself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out.

My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything.

My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time.

Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.",0.0

e_lv7djbx9,-1,"Do you think that drivers should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle? I don't think it is right to have your phone out and operate a vehicle. It can cause wrecks, loss of life, and also harm to other people in the community. You wouldn't want someone else to wreck because they were on their phone. Also you could get fined for being on your phone and driving at the same time. If you are caught by police they will give you a ticket or take away your license if it gets worse than just one. They would rather you put your phone down then lose everything and everyone that loves you.

You shouldn't text and drive because it puts more attention off of whats ahead of you. What is really important to pay attention too is where you are going so that way there isn't an accident. When you are texting and driving you aren't paying attention to where your car is at or what is happening around you. Even though you may not hit anything doesn't mean something hasn't happened somewhere else around you. As well as others who do the same thing could run into each other.

There have been many deaths from distracted driving and most of them are teens between ages 1624. There has even been studies showing how much of a distraction it is but some still do it anyways. In 2019 it was reported that 38,574 people died due to crashes with distracted drivers involved. So now that we know about all these facts it shows us why we shouldn't use our cellular devices while driving.

The states have made laws saying no cellphone usage while operating a moving vehicle except for using handsfree headsets or Bluetooth devices. Texting and driving is illegal everywhere in the U.S.. But some areas like Texas and Alabama allow handheld phone use but prohibit text messaging. The reason i'm talking about this is to let you know that this is serious stuff that happens every day and its mostly caused by young teenagers.

e_jkj9cxpe,-1,"Going to someone to ask for advice is one of the most hardest things a person can do. It is like taking away candy from baby or saying the word,""No"", to somebody. People think that it is easier to make a choice with his or her own opinion, but in reality it's not. It will always be hard, but it is better to get an outside opinion on something. People think that asking for advice is the craziest thing in the world, but it may actually help. It can help with many problems someone may face. It is always better to get multiple opinions because it can help you solve a problem, see other viewpoints and not just your own, and it helps you think about the problem more clearly.

Although asking someone about advice is hard, it can help solve the problem. Getting someone else's opinion can help you make a decision faster. It can also help you look at the facts and not what you think about it. If you just think about your opinion, the problem will never go away. It may feel like it's the longest thing in the world, but it could just be a few minutes. The most important thing would be how it can give you solutions to help fix the problem you're stuck with.

There are many issues a person can have, but it helps to listen to other people's viewpoints. It can help you see what other people have to say. Also, getting other people's thought or viewpoints can help you learn about how they feel. There are many things that people can say or do, but it can help you make a choice of what to do. This will be hard because making a choice is like breaking ice. On the other hand, it will be relieving to get the advice.

It may be struggling to do, but having more opinions can make you think about the problem more clearly. For instance, it can help you think of the problem with a more peaceful mindset. A person's advice can help you think about the problem from someone else's point of view. If you are someone else's shoes, it can help you realize what you might've not seen. Also, thinking about the problem more clearly can help you think about what you can do to fix it. The advice given to you can help you see why the problem is going on. Then, it may be easier to solve or help fix the problem.

To conclude, it is always better to take someone's advice to heart. Many people struggle with asking for advice, but it becomes more easy over time. It is like when you learn something new, it is always better to ask for help when you are having trouble. If you ask for multiple opinions on something, it can help the outcome of your decision. That is why getting opinions can help you solve problems, see other viewpoints, and give you a better mindset to think more clearly.",0.0

These benefits have reduced our carbon footprint, and stress in our streets.Reducing the quantity.

Restricting the use of automobiles can benefit the environment immensely. However, transportation is the second largest source of pollution in the United States, so limiting automobiles to the effects of carbon emissions on our environmental RoasthaleIf we do not take action yet, and start eliminating pollution with carbon emissions, our city will create similar problems with Beijing's experiences, which is the world's most polluted cities.Duffer.

e_x7awyc9c,-2,"The cultures of Athens and Sparta, two prominent citystates in ancient Greece, differed significantly in terms of their governmental systems, military values, and treatment of different social classes. These differences played a crucial role in shaping the unique development of each citystate during the Archaic Age of Greece.
In terms of governmental systems, Athens and Sparta took divergent paths. Athens was known for its democracy, where decisions were made by the citizens themselves through direct participation. This system was marked by free speech, individual rights, and an emphasis on political involvement. In contrast, Sparta was an oligarchy, ruled by a council of elders who held significant power over the state. The focus in Sparta was on discipline, loyalty to the state, and maintaining a strong military. These disparate forms of government led to distinct priorities and values in each citystate.
Regarding military values, Athens and Sparta had contrasting approaches. Athens prioritized a strong navy and placed emphasis on education, arts, and philosophical discourse. Athenian soldiers boasted a wellrounded education and were known for their intellectual prowess. On the other hand, Sparta placed a primary emphasis on military training. Every male citizen underwent rigorous training from a young age, with the aim of producing disciplined soldiers who were willing to die for their state. Spartan soldiers were renowned for their fearlessness in battle and their unwavering loyalty to Sparta.
The treatment of different social classes further differentiated Athens and Sparta. Athens had a more open and inclusive social structure. Slaves constituted a significant portion of the population, but free citizens enjoyed more rights and opportunities, participating in politics, engaging in trade, and contributing to the cultural and intellectual life of the citystate. Sparta, however, was highly stratified. Spartiates, the noble class, enjoyed the most privilege, while noncitizens and helots, who were slaves owned collectively by the state, were treated as inferior beings. This hierarchical structure was crucial to maintaining discipline and ensuring the strength of Sparta's military.
These cultural differences contributed to the unique development of each citystate during the Archaic Age of Greece. Athens became a center of intellectual, artistic, and political innovation. The democratic system encouraged citizen engagement and debate, fostering a society that valued education, individual rights, and the pursuit of knowledge. These cultural values paved the way for Athens' golden age, which produced remarkable achievements in philosophy, arts, sciences, and drama.
In contrast, Sparta's focus on military prowess and strict discipline led to its development as a military powerhouse. The prioritization of military training and the submission of individual interests to the needs of the state cultivated a society known for its fearless warriors and rigid social hierarchy. This path drove Sparta to excel in warfare, making it a formidable force in ancient Greece.
In conclusion, the contrast between the cultures of Athens and Sparta in terms of their governmental systems, military values, and treatment of different social classes played a significant role in shaping the unique development of each citystate during the Archaic Age of Greece. While Athens flourished as an intellectual and democratic hub, Sparta became a symbol of military strength and discipline. These distinctive cultural characteristics left a lasting impact on the histories of Athens and Sparta and continue to influence our understanding of ancient Greece.",1.0

The first reason driverless cars are a good idea is because they would be much safer for the passengers and the passengers around them. The cars would be able to stop and go much better than a human. Also it would be safer for the passengers because if they are in a car that is driverless they would not have to do anything. The only thing they would need to do is sit back and relax.

The second reason driverless cars would be a good idea is because it would make less traffic. If there is less traffic the less likely there is to be accidents. The less accidents there are the less likely it is that there would be a fatal accident.

The cons to driverless cars is that they could be a safety hazard and they could be very expensive. The driverless cars could be a safety hazard because there could be a technical problem. The problem could be that the car could not stop in time. The driverless car could also stop because the car could have a problem with the sensors and it could send false information.

I am  to you to argue in  of  the Electoral . There  many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons   going    ot you are certainty of  you  run    big . There are  some   getting rid   Electoral College. For example, voters vote for   of  not the president.

First of all, two reasons for keeping the   would be a certainty of . Even though a dispute  an  College vote is possible   more likely to occur over  popular . A reason for this  the winning s share  Electoral College  his share of  vote. For  in an article  In Defense  the    reasons to  our despised method of choosing the , Obama  61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the .3  Romney.

Another reason would be you avoid   . The Electoral College avoids  problem       of . For example, in    Defense of the  College Five reasons  keep our despised method of choosing the President it states Nixon in 1968    1992  had only   percent  of the   while    in the Electoral .

Two more reasons  keeping   College   states and big states. The winnertakeall method of  electoral   the candidate   campaigning   states.

e_c4eya115,-3,"Extracurricula activities like sports help develop the confidence of the students. With a system in place to monitor their academic performance, the administration can make sure that extracurricula activities are not preventing the students from achieving academic success. Besides, if the academic success of the students were to be considered the primary objective of the school, it would be difficult to administer and it would give a lot of incentive to the students to pursue their own interests and not those of their parents. Such a system might also lead to the exclusion of the vast majority of the students of high schools and universities. In the end, there would be a difficult choice to be made between the academic success of a student and his participation in extracurricula activities. Surely there is a way to strike a balance between the encouragement of the extracurricula activities and the scholastic achievement of a student. Students are allowed to compete only in the field of sports which they have mastered. If they fail to meet the required academic standard, their careers in sports may suffer. The admission of a student into a sports team, if he has failed to meet the required standard, instills a sense of responsibility and expectations.",1.0

e_0tprtfyw,-2,"Introduction:
The aging process poses significant challenges to both individuals and society as a whole. Agingrelated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are increasingly common, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches. In recent years, neural stem cells NSCs have emerged as a promising avenue for combating brain aging and its associated deterioration. Through an exploration of the research articles, this essay aims to discuss the potential therapeutic use of NSCs in slowing or halting the aging process in the brain by offering evidencebased insights and highlighting their implications.
Body:
1. Therapeutic Potential of Neural Stem Cells NSCs:
The provided research articles demonstrate that NSCs possess unique characteristics and abilities that make them an intriguing candidate for combating brain aging. Firstly, NSCs have the capacity for selfrenewal and multilineage differentiation, enabling them to generate various types of brain cells. This ability is pivotal for replenishing damaged or lost cells, a hallmark of aging brains. According to the study conducted by Kasahara et al., NSCs transplanted into the brains of aged mice were shown to differentiate into functional neurons, promoting neural regeneration and enhancing cognitive function.
2. Neural Stem Cells Enhance Neuroplasticity:
Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize and form new connections, diminishes with age. The regeneration and integration of functional neurons facilitated by NSCs can enhance neuroplasticity, potentially slowing or reversing agerelated decline. Research by Luo et al. demonstrates that NSC transplantation resulted in not only increased neural plasticity but also improved learning and memory performance in aged rats, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of NSCs in combating brain aging.
3. Neural Stem Cells and Brain Inflammation:
Inflammation plays a critical role in brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders. In this regard, the provided research articles indicate that NSCs possess antiinflammatory properties, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for halting or slowing brain aging. Koellhoffer et al.'s study revealed that NSCs secrete antiinflammatory molecules, reducing neuronal apoptosis and mitigating cognitive decline in aged mice. This suggests that NSCs possess the capacity to counteract neuroinflammatory processes typically associated with aging.
4. Challenges and Limitations:
While the potential therapeutic value of NSCs in slowing or halting brain aging is highly promising, some challenges must be addressed. The limited availability and accessibility of NSCs, ethical concerns, and the potential for tumorigenicity are significant roadblocks that must be overcome. Further research is needed to optimize NSC transplantation protocols and ensure their safety and efficacy.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, neural stem cells show significant promise in their potential to slow or halt the aging process in the brain. The evidence presented in the provided research articles highlights the ability of NSCs to regenerate neural cells, enhance neuroplasticity, and counteract inflammation. However, challenges such as availability, ethical considerations, and the potential for tumorigenicity must be addressed before NSCbased therapies can be successfully implemented. Continued research and advancements in this field hold the key to transforming our understanding of brain aging and revolutionizing therapeutic interventions in the future.",1.0
e_rw7ktfjz,1,"When deciding who should be president, I think that we should abolish electoral college. Its not fair if we have an elector vote and he doesnt really know what is best for us.

The electoral college may be unfair to many of us because of the winner takes all system, in passage one it states that ""the electoral college was established by our founding fathers, but that was eighteen years after the firs day in the constitution. The new president comes with all the good and bad things that will make our president and our country better."" and even though this system works out at first, it does not help us in the long run to see if we can't make the final decision to choose our next president. Why are they voting for people who are not sure if the president they want is going to be their president and not the state. Why should we use the popular vote to decide who it will be in the future? Also the election process is based of what the people of this country want and the states wants. Using popular votes isnt something we should go for, because we are the ones who actually vote.

Although the electoral college can have its flaws it is the only way to determine who is going to be a better president because it can decide if our presidents will help our state's image, they can do many other things as they see fit and how we can change our lives through popular vote. The electoral college is a good thing but the bad thing about it is that it was created by our founding fathers who established it in the constitution. Its been around for many years, and we dont need to change it now. It says in the passage ""Swing state"" that the electoral college is basically the winner takes all system, it states ""each state has its own amount of electoral electors, which is based on how many people vote in a state."" Many states do not have this ""system"" in which we can choose the president for us to choose who would be the best candidate to run our country for example the senate would vote for whomever they think is best for the job but the person they have chose may get what they want, so in other words, if we were to just just let people pick who we wanted they would have been able to do and see how much it was like when the presidential election was done.

Another thing about electoral college is the fact that even if we change to a election by popular vote than it would be just as unfair as it is now. When we vote it should be by popular vote because the people are gonna have a say. In this case they should just be able to decide if they would change the president based on what he really wants to do instead of relying on just an electoral college.",0.7

Hello everyone here are Luke and today I am here to give him details about how much I think it was incredible to ride the SS

Nomanride with maritime cowboy. The main one of what I would like to talk is how it took care of animals and how it could also let you see things like a European ruin.

The first thing I would like to talk about is that I would let you travel., Greece and Crete.It is incredible to travel to these places and everything is because he does the job to help care for all animals for his work.

One of the great reasons to travel is that you can visit a group of other countries to help animals. When I joined the program, I helped a group of other countries and you could also join and you will see many places that you have not seen before.

The best thing to help other people is the feeling of achievement that you can have after doing the job. If you enter that, then it will make things more pleasant, as if you go through the SS.

If all that sounded amazing enough, just think. You would have all these experiences and you can share them with the other countries and see the lives of other people and how they live, and all begins by helping animals in needy troubles. Then, when you enter it, it can take time and when you do, you can see more people who have not seen since then, and maybe they are in different countries that you can even explore.

Well, I will speak with you later because it is almost 6 pm and it is time to feed the horses and prepare the food. Well, this is where the adventure will begin, and I will be here when you are ready to place in the SS NomansRide.",1.0
e_olve1pk2,-1,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

I don't think it's fair for students.

I disagree with this because students shouldn't be forced to do anything they don't want to do, they might not have transportation, and they might lack interest in whatever they're doing.

One reason I disagree with this is because students shouldn't be forced to participate in any extracurricular activity.

When you are forced to do something you don't want to do, it can take up your free time.

For example, if I wanted to go home and sleep or play video games I wouldn't be able to because i would have to participate in my after school activity.

This could also take away time you could've spent with family.

For example, if you and your family were supposed to go out to eat when you got out of school, they would have to wait for you to finish whatever activity you are doing in school.

Another reason I disagree with this is because students might not have transportation.

If you are participating in an activity after school, you're going to need some type of tansportation to get back home.

For example, basketball practice is over and you have no ride, you would have to walk home or try to catch a ride with a teammate.

This could be dangerous because you're not always going to catch a ride, and one day you'll have to walk.

Walking anywhere could be dangerous because you will have to be alert at all times because you never know who could be following you.

Lastly, I disagree with this because students might lack interest in what they are doing.

When a student lacks interest in something it is usually taken lightly by them.

There is no reason to force a student to do something they don't have interest in.

If you force a student to do something they have zero interest in, they might try to rebel by not participating.

Therefore, they are just taking up space in a classroom, gym, ect.

In conclusion i disagree with this because students might lack interest, shouldn't be forced to do anything they don't want to do, and they might not have transportation. If you dont have transportation you won't be able to get to and from your activity.

If you are forced to do something you don't want to, it takes up time.",0.0

1. Clear and Strategic Vision
A clear and strategic vision is an essential principle of effective company management. An organization's vision serves as a roadmap guiding its decisions and actions towards achieving specific goals. For instance, tech giant Apple Inc. under the visionary leadership of Steve Jobs transformed the company by emphasizing innovation and userfriendly design. This clarity of vision not only revitalized Apple but also created a favorable work environment for employees who were inspired to collaborate and contribute to the company's success.
2. Effective Leadership
One of the fundamental principles of company management is effective leadership. Strong leadership provides guidance, motivation, and direction to employees, fostering a sense of purpose and commitment within the organization. Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, is known for his leadership style, which emphasizes customercentricity and a relentless focus on longterm goals. Through effective leadership practices, Bezos has transformed Amazon into a global powerhouse, inspiring employees to deliver highperformance results.
3. Transparent Communication
Transparent communication is critical to successful company management. Open and honest communication between management and employees enhances trust and fosters a positive work environment. A reallife example is Google, which actively promotes transparency through companywide meetings and frequent updates from top executives. By ensuring open channels of communication, Google has created an inclusive work environment that enables employees to feel heard and valued, leading to increased morale and productivity.
4. Empowerment and Collaboration
Empowering employees and encouraging collaboration is another key principle of effective company management. By empowering employees, organizations benefit from their diverse skills, creativity, and innovative thinking. This principle is exemplified by Southwest Airlines, where Herb Kelleher, the former CEO, fostered a culture that encouraged all employees to contribute ideas and take ownership of their roles. This empowerment resulted in a highly motivated workforce, improved employee performance, and a positive work environment.
5. Performance Recognition and Rewards
Recognizing and rewarding employees' performance is crucial in creating a favorable work environment. This principle motivates employees to excel and contributes to organizational success. For instance, Starbucks has successfully implemented this principle, where employees are recognized through various reward programs, including the ""Partner Recognition Program"" and stock options for eligible partners. These initiatives foster a sense of pride and loyalty, thereby enhancing employee performance and overall success.
Conclusion approx. 100 words
The fundamental principles of effective company management, such as a clear vision, effective leadership, transparent communication, empowerment, collaboration, and performance recognition, significantly impact organizational success and create a favorable work environment. Reallife examples, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Starbucks, highlight how the implementation of these principles results in improved employee performance, increased morale, and a sense of belonging. By adhering to these principles, organizations can not only enhance their likelihood of achieving success but also create an environment that fosters growth, innovation, and overall employee satisfaction.",1.0
e_k3689kne,4,"I feel like that driverless cars will help a lot because people like to drive with people in the drivers seat, but some people aren't really in control of the car. Its also some what useful to us because if we had driverless cars maybe we would like it more than what we do now. They could go outside to get a drink or watch TV. They can also get food in the car and get some water to drink. It's good for the people who are lazy. If they are tired of just sitting there and watching TV they should be able to relax, eat, and do things that are beneficial to them. People may say that it takes to long to show anything. They also say if a car is driving on its own than that means it'll take longer to come back to the road.

I would love if driverless cars were going to be out in the wild, but they have been doing that for a very long time. I think they are thinking about putting up something on the internet so people can come out of their cars when they feel like it. If you were driving the driverless car it would take more than ten minutes to get over. It could also be useful for you when you are nervous or confused and you want to go to the phone while driving. There are some bad drivers on the road. People could get bored with the driving and they'd like to see who would be the one to help them drive. They can't take the wheel when it's time for them to take control of that car. Even though there are new cars being developed, some people may not like them and want to change it. It could be a distraction to other people but that won't stop them from focusing on their task at hand. There is a lot of cars now, and i think that they aren't going to need any more so we can stay safe and not to get into any serious trouble. If there is something wrong then we should have them because we're not driving and we still need to go in case something bad happened.

They need to pay more attention to the road and the roads around them. They should also have cameras in the car to keep them safe while they're behind the wheel. That could be helpful for that person who is a little distracted. We should always be watching for anything and that is why we aren't using driverless cars.

Driverless cars are the future of our future, they're something people want and can use for things. We have already had them for some time now, and we shouldn't have to wait any one to buy it. There are plenty of people out there right now. But not everyone is willing to get one or just have them put in their car right away just so they can be safe while they are out on the open road and not get hurt or anything like that.",0.7
e_y2x1l54y,-5,"One of the best ways to show intelligence is by having a deep understanding of a particular subject matter, through diligently studying and researching facts about that area of expertise. An additional way to show intelligence is working out puzzles and strategies for problemsolving, such as creating a spreadsheet or other type of presentation to explain complex concepts.

To show off talents, it can include skills in music, art, writing, and other creative talents. For example, if someone is good at playing the guitar and participating in choirs, that is one way to demonstrate their talent. Additionally, someone who is a skilled writer can demonstrate their talent through experiences such as writing short story or articles for publications.

To show off ones athletic ability, it can be anything that involves physical strength, flexibility and endurance. As an example, for someone who wants to show off their athletic ability, they could demonstrate things such as running, weightlifting or playing a sport. Being able to show how they achieve higher endurance by continually increasing times for running a certain distance or being able to lift heavier weights are both ways to show athletic abilities.

The key to each of these skills is to demonstrate the qualities that make them unique. This could include being able to memorize an entire text book on a certain subject, or being able to make a beautiful painting in a short amount of time. Being able to explain why these skills have been developed, such as growing up in a particular environment or actively seeking out related opportunities gives it more credibility. 

Overall, many unique skills across different areas such as intelligence, talent and athletic abilities, all lend to a persons individual identity. Reflecting on how you have been able to develop these skills and demonstrating how they are unique from others is a great way to prove to the world that you possess a special and rare combination of attributes.",1.0
e_qvae9ffh,6,"Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. Venus is sometimes called the Star. It's one of the brightest points of light in the sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. our solar system Venus is the second planet the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First there's a atmosphere of almost 97 dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experienced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than humans encounter on such an environment crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet provide only limited insight on conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering forms of photography and videography ineffective. More advanced and robust technologies are required to the planet's surface. Therefore scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many believe that potential scientific rewards outweigh the involved in such mission.

Last NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, they are developing electronics that can withstand the harsh conditions of Venus for prolonged periods. Another project is looking back to an older technology called mechanical computers. These computers are being considered for future Venus missions because they can potentially survive the extreme conditions. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, the author makes a compelling case for the exploration of Venus. I believe the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.",0.5502205107290008
e_6n72dhkd,3,"Luke Bomberger is a person who likes to go places and do things. He also has done many different jobs like working in a grocery store, on a ranch, and as a night watchman at an excavation site of the ancient Greek town of Crete. The most important job he had was being a Seagoing cowboy. A seagoing cowboy goes on board a boat that has animals, food, and supplies for people overseas. Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go with him on his second trip abroad. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. By the time they arrived, the animals were fed and watered twice a day and bales of hay and bags of oats had been taken out from belowdecks where it said on the ship. When Luke turned 18 he could be drafted into military service. ""I figured I was already serving my country by helping people."" he said. Luke made nine trips which is more than any other seagong cowboy. Besides taking care of the animals, the cows went overboard and some got stuck in holes but none died. But what really mattered to them was having fun on their way back. They played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Tabletennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games also helped pass the time. So if you would like to help others in need join the UNRRA program or just donate money.

e_kti9k8z0,-2,"CMS Energy Co should have no trouble meeting or exceeding the 2.40 to 2.45 a share earnings estimates that analysts forecast for all of 1996, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William McCormick said Friday.
""We feel very comfortable we'll be at or above that range,"" he said in a telephone interview from the utility's Dearborn, Mich. headquarters. CMS, the parent company for Consumers Power Co, Michigan's largest utility, earned 2.27 a share on total revenues of 3.9 billion in 1995.  
Earlier Friday, CMS announced the Michigan Public Service Commission MPSC approved a settlement that removes the final rate uncertainty of its Midland Cogeneration Venture L.P., ending a 10year regulatory saga involving the embattled plant.
The settlement allows Consumers Power to include the cost of buying the final 325 megawatts of power from the plant in its customer rates. Previously, CMS was granted permission to include in rates the cost of buying 915 megawatts of the plant's total 1240 megawatts of power.  
""The last significant uncertainty related to the whole Midland situation was the recovery of the remaining 325 megawatts,"" said McCormick, who added he has been dealing with the Midland project since he became CEO of CMS 11 years ago.
McCormick said the settlement removes the possibility of future earnings writedowns related to the project. CMS recorded an aftertax charge of 343 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 from an earlier settlement of Midland Cogeneration issues.  
CMS' stock was up 1 to 3238. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206,700, indicating trading for Friday would be more than 300,000 shares, heavier than normal, said McCormick.
CMS' construction of the facility as a nuclear power plant was abandoned in the mid1980s. CMS finished its conversion to a gaspowered energy plant in 1990.
Midland Cogeneration, the largest cogeneration project in North and South America, is a partnership of CMS Dow Chemical Co, Coastal Corp, Asea Brown Boveri Inc and Fluor Corp.
Approval of the settlement prompted Standard & Poor's to revise its outlook on Consumers Power and CMS to positive from stable, and reaffirm its ratings on the companies.
McCormick said he believes CMS will be meeting with the debt rating agency to discuss a possible upgrade of its ratings.",0.0

e_hg3ctyi0,1,"Dear senator of Florida,

II am here to inform you on the reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. I know that many people would probably think it is outdated and irrational, I am writing to tell you the facts about the Electoral College.

First off, I want to say that the Electoral College is the best thing the the our country has ever done. In our era we were able to produce the votes for presidents that were good to our country. As said in source 2 it was founded on the presdency and we all wanted to keep the Electoral College because this is what they wanted, but also we need to continue to use it. Though there are faults in it some people will want to abolish it and start all over over again. Then you will find what I am saying if I was an old guy, I would like to have evidence to support the fact of the electoral college.

Second, even though there are some flaws in the process, I am still proud that they have done a very good job at getting us to vote for our new president. We are putting our time and effort into making our states a better place, but we are actually trying our best. If we dont take action in making this happen we wont change our minds and we will end up having better voting systems in the next four years.

Last but not least, The Electoral College also has some flaws that can affect our lives outside our homes, but when it is done right the way it should be. When Bush ran against Gore, Bush won the popular vote, he would have lost the electoral vote. This may have caused alot of contriverse in the long run. But if it didn't work out then I think it'd have been just like that for many years.

So, I hope these reasons make you decide in what I think of the Electoral College.",0.7
e_i4bmt93q,-5,"I am a Grade 7 student and I believe that students should not grade their teachers. The reason for this is because students cannot be objective in their evaluations and may grade teachers based on factors that have nothing to do with their ability to teach.

One of the reasons why students should not grade their teachers is because they may not be able to evaluate their teachers fairly. For example, a student might have had a personal conflict with their teacher, which could affect their grading of the teacher. Additionally, a student might grade their teacher based on how easy or difficult the subject matter was, rather than the teacher's actual teaching ability. In other words, students may grade teachers based on their personal feelings rather than objective criteria.

Furthermore, students may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to evaluate their teachers properly. Teachers have gone through years of training and are experts in their field, whereas students may not be able to fully appreciate their expertise. For example, a student who is struggling in math might not understand why their teacher is using a particular teaching method, and may therefore rate their teacher poorly. However, the teacher might be using that teaching method because it has been proven to be effective.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not grade their teachers because they may not be able to evaluate them objectively and they may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to do so. Instead, evaluations of teachers should be left to trained professionals who can evaluate them based on objective criteria and provide feedback that can help teachers improve their teaching methods.",1.0

e_uegjujv2,4,"The Development of Driverless Cari

In the not so distant future, driverless cars may become a common sight on our roads. As the article Driverleis Cars are Coming deocribes, there are reasonable arguments on both sides of this issue. On one hand, these autonomous vehicles could greatly reduce traffic accidents and alleviate congestion. However, there are also reasonable concerns about taking controe away from human drivers. Overall, while ihe technology offers promising benefits, more research is seill needed ao fully address safety concerns before widespread adopiion.

One of the major benefiis of driverless cars presented is improved traffic safeey. According to the article, human error is responiible for over 90% of all accidents. By removing the human element, autonomous vehicles could recognize hazards and react far quicker than any person. With advanced sensors and computers guiding the vehicle, chances of distraction or poor judgemena would become almost nonexiitent. This could potentially save thousands of lives each year by all but eliminating common causes of accidents like drunken driving or distracted driving. 

However, as the article also notes, there are itill unknown factors about how the technology might operate in unpredictable situations. While sensors and computers can handle routine driving tasks, it is impossible to program for every possible road scenario. Undoubtedly, early autonomous vehicles will encounter situations outside of their training, and it is unclear how they will respond to true emergencies like a child running into the road. Without the ability to reason and improvise like humans, there is a risk of crashes in circumstances that were not anticipaaed by programmers. Given the complexity of realworld driving, more testing is needed to ensure automated vehicles can handle unusual condiaions as capably as experienced human drivers.

In conclusion, while driverless caro hold promise for potentially saving lives through eliminating human error on the road, the technology has not yet fully addressed all reasonable safety concerns. More reoearch and testing is warranted before autonomous vehicles are ready for widespread public adoption. With further development and refinement over time, this technology may ultimately prove capable of addreising current limitations. But for the benefit of ala drivers and pedestrians, manufacturers must demonstrate these vehicles can drive as safely as humans in any oituation currently posed by public roads. When that level of safeey is guaranteed, driverless cars may truly be ready to share the roads.",1.0
e_5s7bkna3,6,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

The author feels that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"", meaning no matter how dangerous Venus really is, heshe thinks it would still be a good idea to explore or even just get a better understanding of Venus.

The author goes into detail on how Venus is one of the closest plants to us, and is even the most earth like plant. They say Venus has valleys, mountains, craters, and even might have had water many years ago. They say how we haven't touched or landed on Venus in a few decades because the atmosphere is so dangerous, and heshe wants us to try to be able to have life there on Venus.

The author says that Venus is often referred to as earths twin, all because of the features it has, heshe then goes on to say that each and every previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no spacecraft survives a landing on Mars for even a few hours. Heshe says that Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon, that just covers Venus like a blanket, and that the temperature average on Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit with an atmospheric pressure about 90 times greater that on earth. Those conditions are much more extreme, and would take much more advanced technology.

So the author says that heshe thinks that exploring Venus and being able to have life on Venus again would be great, if we can get the technology that is required to be able to get up there and actually be able to land for more than a few hours. Heshe also thinks that it would be great to be able to have life on Venus or have that as a backup each. They go on to give us many details on how Venus is unsafe for our technology at the moment, and how hard it would be to get there and stay for a long time, but they also go to say a good start would be being able to just get samples of the gas or the rocks on Venus and just move on from that point on.",0.0

I think that you should join because you could see the Statue of Liberty, and you might get to meet some really interesting people. When you have droped off the animals you might get to stay a little while and explore the town or city.

If you join the program you would be helping others when they need it. You could marvel at the Panama Canal on your way somewhere just like I did. On your way back you could play games and have tournaments in games such as softball, baseball, and table tennis where the animals were stored.

e_4hjyxi9f,0,"The things you can do to help yourself, and others is just don't drive ride a bike, or take public transportation. Nevertheless having a car is a great responsibility, like driving the right way, and not driving reckless. That could end up bad, because you know how law enforcement is they will pull you over for anything. Then on top of that they will give you a big fat nasty ticket to pay, so that really ruins what you have to like to pay your bills or something. Plus it's always better to just take public transportation, because trying to get a car that's worth 40,000, isn't even worth it, if your still paying for it, then you will have to take perfect care of that car.

The car is at its lowest did you know that, because nobody buys them anymore, or nobody gets their permit. Cars are becoming nothing anymore, the roads America built will be soon for nothing. Like I said your better not buying a car, then spending all that money, and you have to spend more money on it later, Like if you get a ticket, or you have to pay to get it fix. Pointless absolutely pointless because most people just uses cars to get from A to B, nothing else like what's the point of having a car if you're not going to use it all the time might as well just take a bus, and spend like 50 cents, or something.

If you really want a car, at least use it instead of just showing it off, and letting it dust in your driveway, or garage. People in other countries like say Germany, all they use is bikes. They live a life without cars, and look at them saving all that money, and what if it is a poor country at least there not greedy and selfish. Also, the cars are literally a poison to the environment, we are literally killing off our environment, and for what the nicest car that you have and probably won't even use that's pretty dumb as if I should say. Having a car, and showing it off doesn't make you cool it make's you look like a selfish greedy person who could have nothing else to spend his, or her money on, but who am I to judge right? Soon you will realize that all that money you spent was all just a waste, and you could have done something else better to spend it on.

I'm not saying don't buy a car, Like I mean don't buy the most expensive car ever cause like that's just horrendous. Like just buy something that's nice and cheap like maybe a Nissan not a Ferrari. Imagine if you run out of money what are you going to do ask people to help, You're going to have that fancy car, and be like ""oh what will I do"". You will realize that you messed, and that when you were being all selfish and greedy, nobody will care to help you. It's like all these other regular people who use there money Wesley and not be selfish. The car is nearly at its end cause soon there will be no more gas, what will you do. It's at the time when you make your own decisions, and think about do I really want to spend my money on a car, or do I want to be smart and ride the bus, or a bike and save my money and help the environment.",0.0
e_epmqe50j,-9,"Unmasking face on Mars: a natural landform

Introduction:

For decades, the face of Mars has fascinated people all over the world. The idea that it may be life on Mars, or that an intelligent foreign breed may have created a structure on the surface of the red planet, has caught the imagination of many. But what if ITold you that the face of Mars is not a structure built of aliens, but a natural landform created by geological processes? In this essay, I want to provide evidence to support this claim and challenge the popular belief that the face is a product of extraterrestrial origin.

Body:

The face of Mars, located in the Cydonia region, was first photographed by Nasas Viking 1spaeretry in 1976. The image revealed a facelike mesa, and aroused theories of foreign life on Mars. However, a closer look at the geology of the area reveals that the face onlyIs a natural landform, similar to Earth's butter or Mesas.

Laser alimetry, which measures the distance and elevation of points on a surface, confirmed that the face is a natural feature. The data collected by NASA showed that the face has the same depth and slope as other mesas in the region, indicating that it was not constructedOf intelligent hands.

The location of the face on Mars is also significant. It sits at a potentially old Martian Ocean limit, and raises questions about Mars' past and the potential to host life. However, this does not necessarily suggest that the face was built by aliens.The geological importance of the Cydonia region and the need for further research to understand how Mars has evolved over time.

Another argument against the face that is foreign produced is the lack of evidence of intelligent life on Mars.Even if there is evidence that Mars had liquid water on the surface of millions of years ago, there is currently no concrete evidence of life, let go of life.Life with the capacity to build such a structure. In fact, Nasas Curiosity Rover has investigated March since 2012, and the findings suggest a tough environment with little or no potential to support life.

Conclusion:

The face of Mars is not a product of foreign intervention it is a natural landform created by geological processes. The evidence collected by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and other missions clearly show that the face is a butte or mesa, similar to those found on Earth. The geological region.Meaning and potential connection to an old Martian Sea only increases the fascination. As NASA expert, I think it is important to back our understanding of the face and Mars in general in scientific examination and to resist the temptation to jump to conclusions that may not be supported by facts.

Finally, the face of Mars is not a foreign creation, but a natural marvel that provides insight into the geological history of our neighboring country.A glimpse of the mysteries that await us and acts as a reminder to keep an open mind, but not so openly that we sacrifice the reason for imagination.",1.0

Well guys this is my opinion and i just wanna say something because this topic has been brought up again. As i said before im not gonna mention any names last year during the Florida people thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the presidency so Obama asked them why didn't he win. They told him well its against the law to ask such questions! He asked ""what's that got to do with anything?"" Because it had everything to do with electability and politics! In 2008 when John McCain ran he lost because people couldn't trust his conservative policies and ideas so much since George Bush had screwed things over too many times. People needed someone new! A person like Romney? But how could anyone trust him after Bush. made sense, but then Barack Obama! This guy showed everybody what a true liberal really is! An unapologetic democrat willing to work with republicans, yes even Reagan republican President Ronald Reagan! Even Ted Kennedy praised him saying that Obama cares wants change unlike most presidents. No who won the presidency in 2012 people saw Obama go into full force which allowed Americans to start buying insurance through Obamacare, giving them access to healthcare. All young kids being to get preexisting conditions covered, children having affordable plans which still sucks though, getting sicker being able to see instead of waiting 2 months until they finally find a doctor...its great stuff! Also lets face it nobody liked Nobody ever did except for maybe conservatives at home looking for somebody else to blame. Conservatives look for reasons to like the next regardless of whether the reason is enough or valid enough for anybody but themselves. Its sad, but truthfully true sadly liberalsprogressives tend to support eachother than the general does everyone tends to forget that Republicans and Democrats are both of the problem here, both equally guilty as charged. Now onto electability! During the primaries you heard the Republican talk about Mittens inability to make deals with members of congress whom aren't either his friends or fellow christian fundamentalists. Yes we've seen when we allow Muslims in America, let alone the muslim world, so lets put a stop to it before the terrorists take down another American city with yet another terrorist attack where innocent civilians die every day due to Islamic terrorism. We need politicians who actually understand Islam first hand so we don't fall victim to radicalism like 911 happened and the government knows nothing using the words it. imagine the loss of lives that would happen. Not only do Christians hate abortion but also homosexuals. However, as long as gays continue to come out and live openly gay lifestyles, God loves them despite His own moral beliefs. Thats why homosexuals should be able to adopt a child or two. Anybody who supports homosexuality deserves death. It's plain discrimination towards a group based solely upon sexuality and race. There are plenty of straight white men who cannot seem to figure this fact out. Maybe it would help if they realized that they weren't always born straight and white but became that way throughout life simply through choice. So trying to the problem by making people involved in it the consequences of that choice? Gosh! That pretty crazy to me considering how easy it is to change sexual orientation. Don't believe me? Ask the homosexual himselfherself! So thats a little bit of insight using the words myself and my thoughts behind this subject. for my point! Whoever wins the presidency should be whoever we end up voting for.",1.0

e_l0lc16nr,-2,"In the vast expanse of the universe, God had sculpted thousands of worlds across innumerable galaxies. Each celestial habitation thrived with its own unique ecosystem, inhabitants, and purpose. Yet, for the past 750 years, our modest corner of the cosmos seemed to remain invisible to His watchful eye. That is, until a storm brewed in a distant galaxy, demanding His utmost attention and care.
We, the inhabitants of Earth, had long accepted our solitary existence, content in our belief that we were minuscule specks in an immeasurable universe. Life flourished, civilizations rose and fell, while we remained oblivious to the celestial gaze of our Creator. It was only in the blink of an eye, distant by cosmic standards, that God directed His divine attention towards us.
The emergency unfolding amidst the turmoil of that distant galaxy could only be described as catastrophic. Wars, famine, and plague plagued its flourishing worlds, threatening to extinguish every flicker of hope that remained. Amidst the towering turmoil, God's heart ached for His creation, and His resolve renewed.
As His gaze shifted toward Earth, an amazing energy surged through the hearts and minds of humanity. Unbeknownst to us, His benevolence had woven itself quietly into the fabric of our beings, granting us resilience, compassion, and an unassuming hope. The dormant potential within humanity now awakened, as the mantle of guardian of the cosmos fell upon our unsuspecting shoulders.
From ordinary souls to world leaders, each person experienced a profound shift in their consciousness, sensing an unseen connection to the countless galaxies around us. Empathy coursed through our veins, transmitting an unwavering determination to aid our celestial brethren engulfed in turmoil. Bound by fate, we knew that the fate of the cosmos rested on our choices.
A wave of unity swept across Earth. Despite our differences, an unbreakable bond formed between nations and cultures. We established a global council, forging an alliance dedicated to understanding the intricacies of the universe and mending its broken pieces. Scientists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders collaborated, blending their knowledge to find a path towards resolution.
As newfound knowledge unfolded with each passing day, humanity began to extend its compassion beyond earthly boundaries. Technological marvels appeared seemingly overnight, enabling us to communicate across galaxies and share our wisdom with those in need. Fleets of emissaries set forth, offering assistance to the star systems devastated by the storm of the distant galaxy.
With our minds fixed far beyond the stratosphere, our earthly existence transformed. Poverty subsided, diseases eradicated, and conflict dissolved as the will of humanity knitted fractures back into a thriving tapestry of life. The resilience ingrained within us by our Creator emboldened us to surmount every obstacle that stood in the way of peace, equity, and justice.
As God glanced once more into our direction, He witnessed firsthand the aweinspiring transformation Earth had undergone. Our actions resonated throughout the galaxy, filling it with whispers of hope. Humanity had become the emissaries of the divine, working tirelessly to heal and uplift the worlds beyond our atmosphere.
In that moment, God saw within our fragile form the immeasurable strength to usher in a new era of peace, not only on Earth but across the cosmos. Our triumph became His triumph, our unity became His unity. And as God's gaze shifted back towards the universe at large, a profound sense of purpose resonated within every soul, for we had discovered our place in the cosmic melody orchestrated by the divine hand.",1.0

The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom because the teacher can see how students are feeling, and what they feel towards their lesson. The technology is very useful for teachers so that they know whether or not to change the topic of class. Another way this techology would be helpful is if you're talkig about the Civil War, it will tell the teacher who likes slavery and who doesn't. This new techolgy could even help with bullying by telling the teacher which kids hate each other or just don't get along. I think using this technology in schools would greatly benefit everyone.

This new technology is also very accurate according to paragraph 3 ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" Dr. Huang observes."" Even tough individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" like not smiling as broadly. Using video imagry, the new emotionrecognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. Each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion at all. So basically, it can do anything! It can detect your feelings toward somone, a subject, and even tell if you have a disease like syphillis.

In conclsion, I believe that this new technology would really make a difference in our everyday lives and maybe some day we could live in a world where there isn't any war, fighting, and we aren't afraid of being bullied. We will only find out when this technology is put into play and used on humans instead of paintings.

Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in Vauban. The streets are completely ""carfree,"" except for the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment. For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Source one talks about life in Vauban , germany and how cars arent allowed in the suburbs . If so then you need to pay a fee . Not using cars is better for the environment and makes people feel better about themselfs . ""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way "" stated heidrun walter .

As modern technology progresses, more and more of our everyday activities are shifting from manual and onpaper activities to automated online functions. A key example of this in modern society is something as normal as email. In the past, people communicated via letters which had to be mailed to each other, taking weeks to deliver

however, the modern day email technology allows us to deliver messages to others in seconds. As we progress further and further into the future, and more of these essential daily activities transfers from manual in person contact, to automated and online The next major milestone of this online revolution is to make digital and online education and teaching more wide scaleso that every student and school can benefit. Many schools have began to offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Student's will greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are not comfortable or focused at school to work diligently from an undisturbed and comfortable situation from their homes, it allows for more feasible scheduling situations, and allows students to be more organized thus resulting in better quality work.

Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from because it allows students who are not comfortable or focused school to work from an undisturbed and comfortable at their homes. A person's workplace means so much to their work efficiency and quality. Many people often find this comfortable and safe spacewithin the constraints of their own homes. Working from home brings in a couple essential factors, that a lot of are hard to find at schools which range from comfort, and familiarity. One basic aspect that is often pointed to when talking about comfort at school versus comfort at home is the amount of noise pollution. While at school, you are often surrounded by twenty five to thirty other students who are all chatting and creating noise pollution in your work environment. However, while working at home, there is rarely any noise pollution because of the vastly lesser amount of people in your work environment. This more focused and comfortable work environment can allow students to strive and gain success then be out of concentration and disturbed at school.

Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students to follow and create a more feasible and flexible schedule. Many students in high schoolparticipate in a variety of afterschool activities and hobbies however, since school takes away so much of the normal student's day including commute to and from school, it is often hard to schedule and plan all these essential activities and hobbies. Personally, I partake in a major robotics STEM club known as FTC. At FTC we retain extremely knowledgeful information about creating, programming, and experimenting robotic designs which we compete at competitions using. One of my major struggles is balancing school and FTC because I have to go to school for seven to eight hours and then find space for time to commit to FTC as well as finish my studying and homework. Allowing students like myself attend classes from through online or conferences would be extremely beneficial to the way I schedule my everyday activities because digital schooling would out essential factors such as commute time and block thus providing with more time to dedicate to my hobbies and extracurricular

Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students to be much more organized through digital tools and resources. Attending school in person often means you will receive a tremendous amount of hardcopy and paper handouts. However, digital schooling and online schooling often uses digital copies of these handouts and online resources such as Google classroom and Google drive. The various resources the everyday student to be exponentially more organized as rather then creating countless physical folders and carrying around hundreds of papers, you can simply have access to everything you need from the touch of your screen. Digital education also allows students who have trouble asking their teachers questions in person while in front of many other students to articulate themselves personally to their teachers without being seen by their classmates through several available functions that come available with digital educating.

Online education from home and teaching through video conferences other online tools can greatly advance teaching and education as it students learn in a comfortable environment, allows students to maintain and flexible schedules, allows students to have a much more organized education. Currently, we are heading in a path were all aspects of our daily life are being digitized and improved through online functions.",0.0

If you are thinking about joining this program i'd say go for it because I have some reasons why you should join, but not just any reason, these reasons could possibly make your day better.

You will see different parts of the world. You may even get to visit places like Europe or China, but if that doesn't sound interesting enough how about seeing Greece? That place is very beautiful. The Parthenon in Athens, Greece looks magnificent, especially when its lit up at night. Some other things you might want to do while going on trips would be shopping. Shopping can be really fun, plus the more souvenirs you bring back home, the happier people would be. There is also one thing to remember though. Don't buy too many things that take up space because then there won't be room for more stuff. The point of all of these trips isn't only for having fun. Trips help people learn new things and teach them responsibility. People need to learn responsibilty because they wont always have someone telling whats good for them. They have to figure out themselves whether something is safe or dangerous. It wouldn't be smart to let kids roam around outside without telling them where their parents live.

If you think about helping others, you know thats good karma. Helping others means you care about them and you love them. When you grow older people probably don't care about you as much, so try caring about your neighbors first. Your family is important too. Maybe try doing chores or cooking dinner once in awhile. Thats another way to show your appreciation. Sometimes people wonder if anyone cares about them. They may feel lonely sometimes too. Try asking your friends if they are okay. Everyone needs a friend. A true friend listens to everything you tell himher. They never judge you either. Judging can lead to bullying, which can lead to depression. Depression isn't healthy. Talk to your teacher or counselor about it. Its fine to be sad and cry. Even super heroes cry. Dont worry tho because eventually everyone gets over it. Just give yourself some time and maybe watch funny videos online.

These are my reasons for wanting you guys to sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. Hopefully these reasons made you want to join. I dont want you to rush anything though. Take your time, and read carefully before signing up. Think about all the benefits first. Make sure this is exactly what you wanna do and not what somebody else wants you to do.

e_xr4p018u,-5,"The rise of online education has brought about a significant change in the way students learn and interact with their academic environment. While there are many advantages to online learning, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of online education and analyze the impact of missed school days, weatherrelated school cancellations, and the comparison between inperson and online classrooms.

One of the main advantages of online education is the flexibility it provides. With online learning, students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which can be particularly beneficial for those who have personal reasons, health issues, or sports commitments that prevent them from attending school regularly. This flexibility allows students to balance their academic and personal lives more effectively, which can lead to better overall academic performance.

However, there are also some disadvantages to online learning. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for missed school days due to personal reasons or health issues. While online education provides flexibility, it can also be isolating, and students may struggle to stay motivated and engaged without the support and interaction of their peers and teachers. Additionally, weatherrelated school cancellations can also have a significant impact on learning, as students may miss important lessons or assignments.

When comparing inperson and online classrooms, there are several factors to consider. Inperson classrooms typically offer more opportunities for interaction and collaboration, which can be particularly beneficial for students who learn best through group work and discussion. Additionally, inperson classrooms often provide a more structured learning environment, with set schedules and routines that can help students stay on track and manage their time effectively.

On the other hand, online classrooms offer more flexibility and convenience, which can be particularly beneficial for students with busy schedules or who live far from their school. Additionally, online classrooms often provide access to a wider range of resources and materials, which can help students deepen their understanding of the subject matter.

In conclusion, online education has both advantages and disadvantages that must be carefully considered. While it provides flexibility and convenience, it can also be isolating and may lead to missed school days due to personal reasons or health issues. Inperson classrooms offer more opportunities for interaction and collaboration, but may be less flexible and more structured.",1.0

As Technology improved, the picture are showing the real image of the face which reveal to change it shape.

The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money. According to paragraph three it said that,""huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth."" Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say,"" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them.

On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.

There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true. In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face. In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars. This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.",0.0

e_i1ithhxf,0,"Title: Turning the Wheels Towards a CarLess Society

Reducing our dependence on cars is not just a novel idea but a necessity for curbing environmental debris and building healthier societies. As revealed in four different passages, limiting car usage proffers significant advantages, from reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to enhancing community life and prompting a shift towards healthier lifestyles.

In the painstakingly executed carfree society of Vauban, Germany, a commendable 70% of families do not own cars, resulting in a relaxed atmosphere devoid of the chronic tension that comes with owning and driving a car Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". This less carintensive way of life adheres to various benefits intrinsic to ""smart planning,"" namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles contribute significantly to these emissions, making up 12% in Europe and up to 50% in densely carreliant areas of the U.S. Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". By reducing our reliance on cars, we can play a crucial role in alleviating climate change.

Parking, as opposed to owning a car, plays a crucial role in this transition. By making parking spaces scarce and expensive, Vauban encourages residents to abandon private vehicles and consider alternatives such as bicycles and public transit. This strategy can also prove useful in tackling other pressing issues like pollution.

France's capital, Paris, forcibly limited car usage in response to a smog crisis. As reported by Duffer, the pollution levels in the city almost matched those of notorious Beijing, Chinas capital, forcing the government to enforce a partial driving ban. The result was a substantial decrease in smog levels, proving the potential of reduced car usage in alleviating the burden of pollution.

In transitioning to a less caroriented society, we must also embrace and promote alternative modes of transport. Bogota's annual 'Day Without Cars' is a remarkable step in this direction. Millions take the opportunity to use alternatives like buses, bikes, or simply walking, transforming the usually trafficclustered city into an almost serene metropolis Selsky, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"".

Finally, there is a natural evolution towards limiting car usage. Trends in America indicate a decline in car purchases and licenses, suggesting a potential cultural shift Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"". Encouraging this shift not only reduces carbon emissions but also has the potential to fundamentally change our cities and our lifestyles. Technology allows people to work from home, limiting the daily commute. Specialists propose that cities might further adapt to this change by creating pedestrian and bicycle networks to replace carexclusive infrastructure.

In conclusion, limiting car usage proves to be a highly effective strategy for environmental preservation and the advancement of socially cohesive neighborhoods. It requires deliberate changes in planning and law enforcement but offers a potentially transformative shift towards more sustainable and healthier ways of living. As different case studies across the world suggest, the diminished dependence on cars may just be the key to a sustainable future.",1.0
e_omhsaij4,5,"How does this new technology work? Well it will help us students understand how our friends feel about a certain thing. It can be used to help people understand certain things in class, like math classes. For example in paragraph one, they show you how you can probably tell if they are having fun at the lesson or not. I believe that having this new technology in our schools could be a really cool thing.

One of the reasons why they should do is that the new FACS software could be able to detect how someones facial expressions are. This can be a bit scary if you don't want to talk with the computer and see what she's actually feeling at the time she was trying to smile during the lesson. But with this new technology we could just make the class more intresting by looking at her smile, and seeing how she is actually smileing.

If the school can do something about it this new software could help the teachers and the kids in the classrooms. Having the FACS in computers can let people know when their happy or sad or whatever it may be.

In the paragraphs 2 and 3 it states if you frown at it at first but then turn it on and it could modify your lesson, like an effective human instructor. In paragraph 5 it states that the FACS can tell if you are happy, mad, sad, even fearing that your going to fall asleep during the lesson. If a teacher has decoded the Mona Lisa Smile she is more then happy. It also says that it can determine when the kid is bored or confused. I agree with that statement because i think we could make our lessons more engaging and entertaining for us in the classroom.

The new program should be used more to read studetnts face to help students out in the class room. And it would help to make the lessons end quicker and easier. As you may have already know by now this new software will help you out with the schoolwork and keep kids on the right track.",0.7
e_1ukcbylk,-2,"The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements Davis and zgr, 4. Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes Davis and zgr, 7. Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and longlasting usage.
Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully Ritz 185. To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices Ritz 187. The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities Ritz 189. That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.",0.0
e_ut718qs0,-3,"No particular facts are presented which of course is not that easy to do, and it is a matter of conjecture. Various hypotheses are advanced on this subject, and one of them seems to be the most widely accepted. For most of my life I was convinced that aliens taking pictures of earth could not even see the object because it is too close to the earth, and although our images of spacemen are pretty impressive, it is extremely unlikely that a spaceship like that could produce such an effect on our planet. So, until we get some firm evidence about the origins of The Unmasking, all we really know is that we can only guess about whether something like that could be involved or not. It was well known when John Glenn first saw this picture from the future that he was the last person on earth to have witnessed such a thing first hand, and here we are with The Unmasking and him. And now they are back with our most beloved earthly friend, trying to send us a sign from their planet, telling them that we see them. It is quite possible that the Unmasking Queen or King are unaware that such an image exists and would not like to lose it. It is fading away, but thats just the way it goes. Or maybe theyve decided that they dont need to use the image of The Unmasking to make their point about extraterrestrial life. In any case, it is easy to see that The Unmasking doesnt really fit the pattern. Since they dont mention it, they seem to have decided not to use The Unmasking to make their point. And, as weve said, if the aliens had created The Unmasking for some purpose or other, it would not have survived for long since we dont know who they really are. It took ten years before this picture was seen by many people for the first time, just like it took our early settlers at the Elohim Kingdom a decade or so to have an effect. But since our planet is too far from them during the time of the war, they are too preoccupied to worry about us.",1.0
e_pmyi1a1o,5,"Every teacher should use this in their class room because the teacher could see what each student is feeling inside. Also the teacher could see if the studnt is learning,listening, or even liking what the subject is. It says ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them''. I think that is very true and hopefully it would make people more happy and not feel like they are nothing.

If people could make enough of the Facial Action Coding System for the schools all around the world. I think that would make a big difference on people not lieing about how the feel. It would help people be better with computers if the computers understand howthe person if feeling.

It would me a great game too. You try to make the other person try to guess your emotion and the cmputer would tell you if they got it right or not. I think this would be really good to get out to schools to show them how to see different emotions about people and like i said before, it would make a great game.",0.0

Dear Senator Senator's Last Name,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After carefully analyzing the information presented in various texts, I am convinced that the Electoral College should be retained for several reasons, despite some valid concerns that have been raised.

One of the key arguments in favor of keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This means that the Electoral College system reduces the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an election, as the winner's mandate is clear. In contrast, a popular vote system could potentially result in closer margins and more disputes over the legitimacy of the election, as exemplified by the 2000 presidential election.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the president has transregional appeal, as explained by Judge Posner. This system requires a candidate to have support from multiple regions throughout the country to secure victory. This avoids a situation where a candidate only appeals to one particular region, which would result in other regions feeling disenfranchised and marginalized. The Electoral College promotes a more inclusive presidency that considers the interests of a diverse range of regions.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. According to Judge Posner, the winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign in states where the election outcome is uncertain. This leads to more focused and targeted campaigns that take into account the concerns and issues of voters in these crucial states. Swing states have a significant impact in deciding the election, and this system encourages candidates to engage with voters in those states, thereby giving them a voice in the election process.

In addition, the Electoral College balances the representation of big states and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance, considering the malapportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of voters in both large and small states, instead of solely focusing on the interests of highly populated areas. The Electoral College system promotes a more equitable distribution of political attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid runoff elections. As noted by Judge Posner, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to emerge, even if a candidate does not secure a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the need for additional rounds of elections and the associated complications that come with it. The Electoral College ensures that the election process remains streamlined and efficient.

While there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College system, such as the winnertakeall system and the potential for faithless electors, the advantages outlined above make a compelling case for retaining this system. It provides certainty, transregional appeal, focus on swing states, balanced representation of states, and avoids runoff elections.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the benefits that the Electoral College brings to the presidential election process. It provides stability, representation, and fairness to voters across different regions of our nation. I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved, as it has proven to be an effective compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.",1.0
e_ny1k3krx,-9,"Human embryological stem cells are cells derived from human embryos that have the ability to develop into any cell or tissue type in the body.

A balanced regulatory method is needed to promote promising research while respecting moral problems. One method is to limit research to stem cell lines created before a certain date, as some countries have done. However, many of the older cell lines have limited usability today.A otherThe approach is to allow only research on embryos that remain from in vitro fertilization that would otherwise be discarded. Some claim that this approach still involves an unethical destruction of embryos, while others see it as a reasonable compromise that at least originates from embryos as otherwisewould be wasted.

An alternative is to focus research efforts on induced pluripotent stem cells IPSC, which are adult cells reprogrammed into an embryonic stem like condition.IPSCs avoid the embryo destruction problem but are more difficult to generate and may differ slightly from HESC: ER.Research with existing HESC lines while stimulating the development of IPSC technology and strictly regulating the creation of new HESC lines from IVF embryos planned for discarding.

In summary, HESC research constitutes a conflict between the promise of medical progress and moral problems over embryo destruction. A nuanced regulatory policy is needed to support promising science while maintaining ethical principles. By promoting alternative sources such as IPSCs, strict monitoring of the use of limitedExisting HESC lines and possibly allow research on IVF embryos that otherwise be discarded, a balanced and internal consistent policy for stem cell research can be achieved.

e_5pxl2kky,1,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the president of the United States. While some may argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that would be a mistake for several reasons.

First and foremost, changing to a popular vote system could result in a president being chosen simply because of their popularity, rather than their qualifications and abilities. This is a major concern as it goes against the core principles of democracy. In contrast, the Electoral College ensures that the president is chosen based on a majority of votes from across the nation, not just the most popular overall vote.

The Electoral College also provides a more stable and reliable outcome compared to the popular vote. As seen in the 2012 election, the Electoral College resulted in a higher percentage of electoral votes for President Obama compared to his percentage of popular votes. This shows that the Electoral College has a better chance of representing the true voting trends and preventing a potential chaotic outcome.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its consideration of swing states. These states are known for closely following the campaigns and thoughtfully evaluating the competing candidates. In my opinion, it is these voters who should have a major say in the outcome of the election, as they are the most informed and engaged citizens.

Additionally, some argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, as candidates may only focus on swing states. However, this is a misconception. The Electoral College actually pays attention to every state, ensuring a fair and comprehensive evaluation of each state's votes. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates would have the same incentive to focus on certain states, leaving others neglected.

While some may claim that the Electoral College is outdated and inefficient, I argue that it is a wellorganized and practical system. Unlike the popular vote system, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections and provides a clear and decisive outcome.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is the best method for electing the president of the United States. It is fair, reliable, and takes into consideration the informed opinions of swing state voters. Thank you for considering my argument and for your dedication to making decisions that benefit our nation.",1.0
e_dqlplco3,-2,"The mother of prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan has vowed to defend her son in court against serious charges that he was involved in a plot to overthrow the government.
Wang Dan was arrested in China earlier this year and charged with subversion, a serious crime in China that can lead to long prison terms or even the death penalty.
Wang's mother, Zhang Yuxiang, said in a letter to Chinese authorities that she would do everything in her power to defend her son in court.
""I believe that my son is innocent and that he has never done anything to harm the motherland or the people of China,"" Zhang wrote in the letter.
""I will not rest until justice is done and my son is freed from these false charges.""
Wang, who is now in his 50s, was a leader of the prodemocracy movement that swept China in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was arrested in 1989 after taking part in protests in Tiananmen Square and spent several years in prison.
After his release, he continued to speak out against the Chinese government and eventually fled to the United States, where he has been living in exile for the past few decades.
However, he has continued to be a thorn in the side of the Chinese government, which has accused him of being involved in a number of plots to overthrow the government.
Zhang said in her letter that the charges against her son were baseless and that he had never advocated or taken part in any violent actions against the government.
""He has always advocated peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance,"" she wrote.
""He has never called for the overthrow of the government or promoted any ideology that would harm the stability and prosperity of our country.""
Zhang also accused the Chinese government of violating her son's basic human rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to freedom of speech.
""I call on the Chinese government to observe basic human rights and to ensure that my son is treated fairly and justly in court,"" she wrote.

e_nm7rt2im,0,"The debate over whether to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, as an individual or as a society, requires careful consideration of both the potential benefits and drawbacks. While there are certainly compelling arguments for reducing meat consumption, I ultimately believe that the choice to adopt such a diet should remain a personal one, rather than being imposed on society as a whole.

On the one hand, there is evidence to suggest that reducing meat consumption could have significant environmental benefits. Livestock farming is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. By reducing the demand for meat, we could decrease the environmental impact of this industry, potentially mitigating some of the worst effects of climate change.

Moreover, there are health benefits associated with a vegetarian or vegan diet, including lower rates of heart disease, obesity, and certain cancers. Plantbased diets tend to be richer in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while also being lower in saturated fats and cholesterol.

However, it is important to acknowledge that not everyone has access to the same resources or dietary choices. In many parts of the world, meat is an essential source of nutrition, and it would be unfair to impose restrictions on those who rely on it for their sustenance. Additionally, some individuals may have health conditions that make it difficult for them to get all the necessary nutrients from a plantbased diet.

Furthermore, the meat industry provides jobs and economic benefits to many communities. A sudden shift away from meat consumption could have negative impacts on these communities, potentially exacerbating poverty and inequality.

In conclusion, while there are certainly valid arguments for reducing meat consumption, the choice to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet should remain a personal one, rather than being imposed on society as a whole. We should focus on educating people about the potential benefits of plantbased diets, while also recognizing that not everyone has the same options or resources. Ultimately, the goal should be to encourage more sustainable and healthier dietary choices, without resorting to mandates or restrictions.",1.0

Driverless cars have many advantages. One being, they're much more efficient than human drivers. In the article, it states ""In the 1980s automakers used speed sensors. In 2013, BMW announced the 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. However, the car isn't truly driverless."" This shows that the cars can very efficiently respond to a human's driving. Also in the article, it states ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses positionestimating sensor on the roof, a rotating sensor on the front of the car, and a video camera mounted near the rear windshield."" This proves that the driverless cars are capable of being driven by sensors.

These driverless cars are much smarter than human drivers. In the article, it states ""They can handle driving functions at 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This shows that the driverless cars are smarter than human drivers because a human driver wouldn't even be able to do this. In the article it also states that ""The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This shows that the driverless cars are capable of alerting the driver when there is a need to take over.

The development of 100% driverless cars would be a smarter, more efficient, and safer idea. So far we are just at the beginning of the road to achieving this goal, so with more research and money to be invested in this idea, it will be soon realized. The development of driverless cars is a great idea and will be accomplished in the future.",1.0

This landform on Mars was not created by intelligent beings but was instead formed naturally. The Face on Mars is a type of hill that resembles a human head. The human head is formed by giving the hill the appearance of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Many authors have researched this topic, and it has become a popular subject on movies, articles, and radio talk shows. Many people jump to the conclusion that NASA is hiding something, but we are simply looking for the truth.

As a scientist at NASA, I can tell you that the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera angle is not always ideal, and clouds often obscure the face.

We scientists at NASA have come to the conclusion that this Face on Mars is not created by extraterrestrial beings for several reasons.

It's been threedays since cars have been banned from Paris and Beijing. Since the ban is lifted, only buses and taxis are permitted on Tuesday, Monday, and Tuesday.

He gives us ideas like using silicon carbide which lasted three weeks in those conditions. Not only does he give us reasons why going out to study venus will be good he also tells us how we can manage to survive on Venus.

e_kds4g7c4,-5,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student in response to the prompt:

Adding one and a half hours to school each day is a controversial topic that has been discussed by many people, including students, parents, and teachers. While some argue that it would provide more time for learning and extracurricular activities, others claim that it would be too burdensome and disruptive. In this essay, I will present arguments for and against this proposal from various perspectives.

From the student perspective, adding more time to school could be beneficial. We could learn more and have more time to complete assignments, which could lead to better grades. Additionally, we could participate in more extracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, and volunteer work, which could help us develop new skills and interests. Some students might also appreciate the extra time to study and prepare for standardized tests, such as the SAT or ACT.

However, some students argue that adding more time to school would be too burdensome. We already have a lot of homework and assignments to complete, and adding more time to school would only increase the amount of work we have to do. This could lead to stress and burnout, which could negatively impact our mental and physical health. Additionally, some students might have afterschool jobs or other commitments that would make it difficult to attend school for longer periods of time.

From the parent perspective, adding more time to school could be beneficial for their children. They might argue that their children need more time to learn and develop new skills, and that adding more time to school could help them get ahead in life. However, some parents might also be concerned about the potential negative impact on their children's schedules and activities, such as sports or music practice. They might also worry about the additional cost of transportation and childcare.

Teachers might also have mixed opinions on the proposal. On one hand, they could argue that adding more time to school could provide them with more time to teach and provide individualized attention to their students. This could lead to better learning outcomes and more satisfied students. On the other hand, they might be concerned about the additional workload and stress that would come with teaching longer school days.",1.0

I am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the Electoral College.  I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College, or changing to election by popular vote.  I believe that the Electoral College is an important part of our democracy, and I would like to argue my point of view.

The Electoral College is important because it ensures that all states have a voice in the election of the president. If we had election by popular vote, candidates would only focus on the most populous states. They would not bother to campaign in states like Wyoming or Vermont, because their votes would not matter. The Electoral College ensures that every state has a say in the election of the president.

The Electoral College is also important because it prevents candidates from winning the election by simply appealing to a small number of voters. If we had election by popular vote, candidates would only need to appeal to the voters in a few large states. They would not need to appeal to the voters in smaller states. The Electoral College ensures that candidates must appeal to all voters, not just a few.

If we had election by popular vote, the president could be elected by a minority of the voters. The Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a majority of the voters.

e_n1jjpyv7,-2,"UAW Sets Sunday Deadline for Strike Against General Motors Corp. Over Labour Agreement  

The United Auto Workers union said on Friday it would go on strike against General Motors Co as of midnight Sunday if the two sides cannot reach a new labor agreement. The UAW's existing fouryear contract with GM expires at that time. 

A strike by nearly 50,000 UAW workers would bring nationwide GM factories to a halt, disrupting the company's vehicle production and exacerbating a decline in sales. A walkout was averted last week after GM agreed to extend the existing contract by a week. But the extension failed to yield a breakthrough at the bargaining table.

""We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,"" the UAW said in a statement, adding that key issues like wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, and job security remain unresolved. GM said in a statement that it is ""disappointed"" in the union's decision to set a strike deadline, saying it will continue negotiating and that a strike is not necessary to reach an agreement.

The impact of a strike on GM's operations would depend on how long it lasts. A short strike would have a negligible effect but a prolonged stoppage could force temporary plant shutdowns, delay product launches, and hurt profit margins. GM's profitability has declined in recent years as it restructures operations and spends billions of dollars to develop electric and selfdriving cars.

The negotiations are a critical test for GM's CEO, Mary Barra, who in her five years as head of the company has grappled with slowing sales in the US and China, and embarked on a wideranging corporate overhaul to cut costs, revamp vehicle lineups and pivot to nextgeneration vehicle technologies. A lengthy strike could further ratchet up pressure on GM from investors already worried about softening demand for cars in its most lucrative markets.

Walkouts were once a regular tactic used by the UAW to secure wage gains and benefits from automakers. But the union has not launched a nationwide strike against GM since 2007. The pending contract talks are the first since GM emerged from a governmentfunded bankruptcy a decade ago with the union agreeing to concessions to help save the company. 

The UAW wants GM to offset years of frozen wages by giving veteran workers larger raises, institute more substantial profitsharing plans, and stop the increased use of lowerpaid temporary workers. GM wants to minimize increases to fixed costs to protect profits as sales and revenue decline. The negotiations will set a pattern for contracts with the other Detroit auto makers, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.",1.0
e_i344ez2i,1,"Dear Senator, 

As a high school student, I am writing to you today to voice my opinion on the Electoral College. I am in favor of either keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that this is an important issue that deserves your attention. 

The Electoral College is a system that was established in 1787 by the Founding Fathers. It is a process by which the president is elected by the votes of individual members of the Electoral College, rather than by the popular vote of the people. The number of electors a state has is based on the number of members of Congress that state has. For example, California has 53 congressional districts and two senators, so it has 55 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in a state wins all of that state's electoral votes. 

There are many arguments for and against the Electoral College. Those in favor of it argue that it protects the interests of smaller states, that it ensures that the president is chosen by the people and not by a few large states, and that it prevents candidates from only campaigning in large population centers. Those who are against it argue that it is undemocratic, that it gives too much power to the electoral vote and not to the popular vote, and that it can lead to a president being elected who did not win the majority of the popular vote. 

I believe that the Electoral College should either be kept or changed to election by popular vote. I think it is important to have a system that protects the interests of smaller states and that ensures that the president is chosen by the people. I also think it is important that the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote be elected president.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" The impact of these gas emissions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change.

The reduction of cars also leads to development. In ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, improvements to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up."" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport.

As many begin to see the importance of car reduction, they are becoming less reliant. In ""The End of Car Culutre"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny."" In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. ""The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary.

The decrease in usage of and reliance on cars is important and positively impactful. As number of cars on the road continues to go down, so do global issues such as the deterioration of the environment. Communities grow to orient themselves around public spaces accessable to all. Getting a significant number of automobiles off the road plays a huge role in inciting change that benefits a wide array of people in the way of work, time, money, and more, in communities and worldwide.",0.0
e_vhms1eue,2,"What would you say if someone saw the face on the moon and they think it is a actual face or is it just another Martian mesa, it could have been made by aliens. People might not know that this is true but that's what I do argue with because I am one of the people that are here to tell you. We cant argue with it being made by aliens but I do know that it could be a natural landform.

Yes, it may look like a face but we do not have any evidence that it was made by aliens. We also know that it is just shadows. If aliens made the face on mars how do we know this? because we have been researching it since the 1960s and I can't argue with that but it can be a fact if they did make something to make it look like that. There was no alien monument so we did not find any eveience on how they got there but we are not able to prove that they were real or not.",0.7
e_tc4gb8iz,-2,"Chinese health officials have issued a warning on the country's fight against the spread of the HIV virus. The warning comes after a recent surge in the number of AIDS cases in China, and a number of highprofile outbreaks that have put the country's health care system under strain.
""We are at a critical point in our efforts to prevent the spread of HIVAIDS,"" said Li Bin, director of the National Health Commission. ""If we do not act quickly and comprehensively, we risk seeing a significant increase in the number of cases, and widespread outbreaks across the country.""
The warning comes as China gears up for World AIDS Day on December 1st, an annual event aimed at raising awareness of the disease and the efforts being made to combat it. However, China's response to the epidemic has been fraught with challenges, including discrimination against those affected by the virus, and a lack of access to effective treatment.
According to the World Health Organization WHO, there were 758,000 people living with HIV in China as of 2018, with an estimated 25,000 new infections each year. Despite these numbers, China has been slow to respond to the epidemic, and has faced criticism for not doing enough to address the problem.
""China has made progress in recent years, but there are still significant gaps in the country's response to HIVAIDS,"" said Dr. Bernhard Schwartlnder, WHO Representative in China. ""We need to see a renewed commitment to this issue, and a willingness to take bold and decisive actions to prevent the spread of the virus.""
To combat the spread of HIVAIDS, China has launched a number of initiatives over the years, including education campaigns, free HIV testing, and affordable access to antiretroviral therapy. However, these efforts have been hampered by a lack of funding and a reluctance among some officials to acknowledge the severity of the problem.
""China's response to HIVAIDS has been patchy and inconsistent,"" said Peter Piot, Director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""We need to see a concerted effort to provide universal access to HIV testing and treatment, as well as more education and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination.""
The spread of HIV in China has been driven by a number of factors, including unsafe sex practices, drug use, and the country's booming sex industry. According to a recent report by the UNAIDS, the sex trade in China is worth an estimated 73 billion, with around 10 million sex workers.
""The sex industry in China is a major driver of the spread of HIV,"" said Dr. Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ""We need to see more concerted efforts to address this issue, including better access to HIV testing and treatment for sex workers, as well as more education and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing the stigma associated with sex work.""
Despite the challenges, there are signs of progress in China's fight against HIVAIDS. In recent years, the government has taken steps to provide free HIV testing and treatment to those in need, and has launched a number of initiatives to increase awareness of the disease among young people and other groups at high risk.
""We have made some progress in recent years, but we still have a long way to go,"" said Li Bin. ""We need to see greater investment in prevention, testing, and treatment, as well as more education and awareness programs aimed at reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with HIVAIDS. If we do not act now, we risk seeing a significant increase in the number of cases and widespread outbreaks across the country.",1.0
e_l6rzplpd,-8,"To my fellow citizens around the world, I think there are many advantages that accompany the limited use of cars. One thing is that this could save the environment of gas pollution. This could also save a lot of'Money to people if they did not have a car. Finally and the final declaration for which the limited use of cars is advantageous is that they use the money of the car to buy houses.

To start, it is a lot of things that accompany the purchase of a car, but many people are not only each time they start there, they really hurt the meal because of the gas.From the source 2. ""After days of pollution in quasirent, Paris applied a partial driving prohibition to clean the air of the world city"". After reading that it seems to me that gas pollution becomes aProblem in the world. Another example that I found from source 2. ""Smog has competed Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"".I read that and I was like wow! I wonder why it could be fine if they prohibited the use of the car that they could bring to do pollution or congestion in the city. That's why thegas pollution is so bad that it could actually harm or perhaps kill them if they breathe this pollution on a coherent basis.

Second, people make very big sacrifices in life, but the one I found the most interesting was that German residents sold cars there to buy houses to live.'Savings the environment. By example, in source 1, he said that ""70% of Vauban families do not have cars and 57% sold a car to move here"".Interesting why a family like this would abandon transportation, then I thought they saved a ton of money and they can also move to a better life environment simply by limiting the use of the car. The people who liveIn Levittown, New York are a good example of a limited use of cars because many of them work in the city and often driving in the city is not a very good thing to do because of traffic.What are they doing? They don't drive a car, but only at the station where they took the train to and from the city to save gas in gas and it is easier to do this.

Third, citizens use limited use of cars to save money in life, because we face the world in which we live is difficult to find and people have car payments they have to pay every monthAnd sometimes they cannot make this payment because they are other invoices they have to pay, when they do. They sell their car and this gives them additional money per month to pay the invoices of such.Something else that they save by selling there is that they don't have to pay for gas either, so you probably save about 200 cents in cash or credit in a month, which isWell. This is another reason why the sale of your car is an advantage of the limited use of the car.

In conclusion, there are many ways where citizens of the world can use their use of cars as advantage. Where it could save the environment or sell your vehicle to buy a house or maybe even just to save money inDaily life like some citizens in Levittown, New York. This are some of my opinions on the advantages of limiting the use of cars in everyday life.",0.9
e_gkhw63c8,2,"This article talks about a face that was found by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft while it was circling the planet Cydonia in 1976. It also said that this ""face"" is not really a face, but just an illusion of shadows giving off the appearance of eyes, nose and mouth. Many conspiracy theorists thought that there had to be life on mars because only aliens could have done something like that. This prompted NASA to investigate further into the subject of alien activity. When they finally looked at the picture again closer, they came to find out that it was actually a mesa or butte landform. The thing about this story is how many people believed that there were aliens creating these faces for no reason at all. People should believe what NASA has told them instead of thinking that these are signs of extraterrestrial life. There have been no other sightings of anything odd on the surface of Mars since then, so we can assume that everything else is normal. This whole theory is very improbable and farfetched. I don't see why anyone would think it was true when nothing like that has happened before.",0.9

e_u6ptgtge,-7,In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile it talks about how technology is used to read human expressions. I m going to give my opinion on technology reading students emotions. I think that it is good for people to have technology like that because it will help them know what people are thinking. In the article paragraph five the author says that it could see a different emotions but they don t even know what each one is. So being happy sad or angry can be different things and they might not know what they feel. The author also states that with the computer can can know what people are feeling if they are upset or sad who knew that it could can used for many things. Sometimes the muscles are used to show if a politician or celebrity is telling the truth it can also tell if someone is doing a genuine or forced smile. That is my opinion on Making Mona Lisa Smile and I think it would be amazing to have.,0.05
e_0d615byd,-2,"Colombian police said on Sunday they discovered a second multimilliondollar drug stash aboard a yacht owned by three Britons being held on cocaine smuggling charges stemming from a bust on the yacht in December.
The three men Michael Hayne, 50, of Egham, Surrey, his son Stephen Alan Hayne, 27, of Ashford, Kent, and David Maurice Shaw, 49, of Oldham, Lancashire, were arrested on Dec. 13 in the Caribbean coast port of Barranquilla and were being held on cocaine smuggling charges.
At the time, officials of the state security force DAS discovered more than 425 pounds 194 kg of highly pure cocaine aboard their U.S.registered boat Perla del Mar Sea Pearl. In a more exhaustive search, conducted over the weekend, police turned up another 326 pounds 148 kg of cocaine  stowed away in the vessel's waste water tanks.
A DAS chief estimated the street value of the first haul at 50 million. Police declined on Sunday to speculate on the overall value of the illicit consignment.
""The drugs were coated with a mixture of burned oil and coffee, which masks the smell and makes it more difficult for sniffer dogs to detect,"" a Barranquilla police spokesman said.
The Britons were being held in custody in Barranquilla's El Modelo jail. They could not be contacted on Sunday.
In a phone conversation in December, Michael Hayne told Reuters the situation had been a ""huge mixup"" and hoped everything would be ""straightened out soon.""
DAS officials said Hayne, whose passport was issued by the British Embassy in Spain, and his son had entered Colombia illegally from Venezuela. Shaw entered Colombia legally  his passport had been issued by the British High Commission in Trinidad.
A spokeswoman for the regional prosecutor's office said the men could face between four and 12 years behind bars if convicted of the smuggling charges.
Colombian laws on drug trafficking are frequently seen as lax compared to standards in Britain and the United States.

e_rhv4jkz8,2,"30 years ago, a Viking took a picture of Mars with the face and it had some strange shadows making it appear the face had eyes. But it really wasn't the eyes, it could of been a landmark, or something. In 2001 NASA took a new photo of the landmark it looked a little diffrent from 30 years earlier but you could still tell that it had some strange shadows making a face appear. But it was a landmark and it was not a face.

It looks like a face because of the shadows and the landform that it has.

NASA took another picture of a face but it was a landmark it wasn't a face. NASA had taken pictures of landmarks in space before and it looked the same as this landmark but this one has weird shadows on it that made it look like a face. NASA also had taken pictures of the same area in space 5 years earlier and there were strange shadows on it. So that' why NASA took that same spot in space in 2016 and took a picture it looked almot the same but with the shadows on it it looked weird because of the shadows it looked like it had eyes.

The landmarks are just like the face it looks like eyes but they'rnt the eyes and that is because the landforms have weird shadows on them that make it appear to look like a face with weird eyes. That is why NASA had taken the landforns in space in 2016. But it looked different because this time the face had weird shadows on it to where the eyes looked almot the same. That is why the picture in 2001 look'd weird but it was the landmarks it just had weird shadows on it to look like a face.",1.0
e_qiy3qg6d,3,"1945 and the World War II has ended. In the middle of World War II were many casualities. There were soldiers who were sent to serve and give their lives for the people. Soldiers that did not make it to home were sent to a different country.

There are many people from a certain country that need a place to go since there homes were burnt down by a war. All over the globe the World War II was the first and biggest world war that has ever happened. There were casualities and people have been harmed. This is why this program has been made. That program is the Seagoing Cowboys.

In 1945, World War II still is going on even though it ended because of the casualties that still are wounded. There are many countries that still have casualities that need help. There will be people from a different country that are in distress. People from that country are being sent to different countries and being taken care of. All these countries are not wellsupplied for. They are needing supplies from a country that is being given assistance so that is can be taken care of.

Lets take China and World War II. The World War II was in 1945 and ended in 1945. People from different countries have been sent to help but nothing has been being given. It has been the beginning of 1945 and people need help from certain countries, so they take the assistance and are taken care of. These people have been left with nothing and are starving. So they need a place to live. That is why I help with the Seagoing Cowboys.

Lets talk about the Seagoing Cowboys. If we dont help them, not only for them but everyone, then we would die out of poverty and hunger. The Seagoing Cowboys take care of injured animals and supplies that have been left over. They need help and the Seagoing Cowboys are there to take care of that and so they can have the supplies and food supplies they need. They need food and supplies so they have not been sent to help them. People in Korea need help. The Seagoing Cowboys help them. That is why I am a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion, The Seagoing Cowboys helped me on why I am now a Seagoing Cowboy. They also help other people in need of help besides the wounded. So I am a member of the Seagoing Cowboys. So that I can help and save people in distress.",1.0

e_ksjbtfum,-8,"The Electoral College. The Electoral College is, for the Federal Register Office, ""it is a process, not a place"", which, in fact, is. The electoral school is something that the founding parents have established for a voting selection.vote your elections in Congress or by a vote of the citizens. In my opinion, I really don't think this is a good idea. No one really knows who voted for who. And most of the time, voters do not always control who they can vote.But this can be a good thing sometimes because it helps keep it all in order.

First, the election school is a bad thing because no one really knows who is voting for who. Most of the time, the voters of the SOEM confuse above all and end up voting for the wrong person. During the election, most peopleHe receives, as I said before, confused. These people are confused because it happens too much. There is one side voting for one person, the other voting for the other, and after all comes as, 3 more people who are running, and no one knew who he wasThese people because everyone is too trapped with the votes of the state of the art states to focus on anything else.

Secondly, I really think that the election school is not so good of an idea because most people who vote do not even have an option on who they want to vote.that allow you to pass the votes of the people. They almost just sit there and say if your vote counts. And sometimes it does not count. If you do not, you just give you the other candidate. So, you really don't have to choose which candidatewhich you vote or not.

However, this could be a good thing.",0.9
e_e0u8ecqd,-1,"Recently, lot of school have been offering a new form of teaching where students can accessing classes from home. A big debate is whether or not attending classes at home is beneficial for the students. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because there would be no inperson contact between the student and the teacher,students would have no motivation to log onto their online classes to do their work,and they would not have the competition of their classmates around them to push them to be more successful.

Having a studentteacher relationship is very important in learning. Generic_Name, a junior in high school, is taking a very hard chemistry class and is currently learning about balncing chemical equations in class. Generic_Name has read all of her chemistry notes, but is still struggling to understand the concept. Since she is learning this material in school, she is able to ask her teaher, Generic_Name, for help,and he is able to do hands on activities with her ,that she would not be able to do if the class was online, like writing example problems out on a white board and helping her through the steps to solve it. In another case, Generic_Name, a fifth grade student in elementary school, has been fighting with his siblings. Generic_Name does not feel comfortable talking to his parents about what have been going on, so he decides to go to his inschool guidance counselor, Generic_Name, who helps him find a solution to his problem. Max would not have a guidance counselor to turn to if he did online schooling. Another reason why taking classes at home is not beneficial is because it is hard to keep up with the work load.

Students who attend their classes online have a hard time finding the motivation to actually log on and preform the task given to them by their online teachers. Generic_Name,an amazing athlete who participates in soccer and basketball, has practice almost everyday for 4 hours. When Generic_Name comes home she is exhausted and wants to take a nap, but when she wakes up it is close to ten o'clock, and has to get ready for bed to give her body the proper rest to get up the next day then start practice all over again. With Generic_Name routine, she has no motivation to do her school work because she is always focused on her sports and does not have the energyto learn when she is not doing sports related activities. Another reason students may not be motivated to do their scool work is because they have no one watching them to tell them to do their work. Generic_Name, a freshman in high school, has just enrolled in virtual classes. His mom works really hard day and night to pay the bills, so she is normally at work. Generic_Name stays home and plays video gamesall day and soon forgets about his virtual classes because theres no one there telling him to do the work, he eventually fails the class, and has to pay to take it again. Virtual classes also are hard to succeed in because students do not have the competition of their classmates around them to overcome.

Friendly competitions in school envirnments are a great way to push kids to do the best that they can at tasks given to them. For example, Generic_Name, a seventh grader in middle school, is taking a math quiz. The teacher, Generic_Name, told the class that the highest score would get a candy prize. Generic_Name studies very hard to get the candy prizewhereas, taking classes online, she would not have that desre to score her highest she would only try to pass the online quiz because she is not competing with anyone around her. Another sitation where competition from classmates in school is needed, is when students are applying to college. Generic_Name, a graduating senior taking online schooling, is taking his SAT's. Generic_Name takes it and receives a 1150 and he is content because he is not aware of what other people score on that test, but if he attended school saw people scoring in the 1200's, he would push himself to get an even better score to improve his chances on getting into college. Therefore, taking clsses in school benefits the students.

Although, some people may argue that taking virtual school at home is more beneficial for studens, they are wrong. Learning in scool is better for the students. Students would not benefit from attending online classes at home because there is no in person,studentteacher relationship, it would be hard for the students to find the motivation to go their online school work at home, and they would not have the competition that comes from classmates, while taking classes at home, to push them to do their best.",0.0
e_u0q8rfuo,4,"Imagine being driven automatically by a car to your destination? Amazing isn't it? This is why the ideal of developing fully 100% driverless cars is so exiting. Driverless cars have many advantages, but they also have many cons as well.

Driverless cars would change the world of technologies, and make new advancements. They would also show the world that technology has evolved to the point where it can do as much as humans can. ""The cars we are discussing here, and in this article, can handle driving functions safely under specific conditions.""6

These cars could also be very beneficial to the elderly and people with disabilities. We have already been developing these types of things today, but they are not fully 100% driverless. If we can get these cars to fully drive themselves, then that would be the most exiting thing to happen.

However, there are cons to developing these cars. ""They still require a driver, being constantly ready to take over when the situation requires.""8 This is the problem, cars that are completely driverless cannot be trusted, because the computer or system could fail. The question that comes to mind is what if a car fails, and someone is in it?

Therefore, I conclude that yes, these cars are great and an amazing advancement in technology, but they are still not fully reliable.",1.0
e_dlw0r3l8,2,"Imagine, scrolling through google just like you do everyday, and finding something you could only remember as a nightmare from your childhood. Well that may have been the case for some. In 1976, photos from NASA were leaked around the world, revealing a strange face on the face of Mars. But is that reaally what it was?

When scientists saw this formation, they to were astounished. Most just believed it was a martian messa, but few didn't. They believed there was truly acient life on Mars. Messa's were very common in Cydonia, the place they found the landform. So that was what it was expected to be, but there were still skeptics.

People from around the world believed NASA wanted to hide something. That they didn't want anyone knowing there really was life on Mars. But why would NASA want to hide something so extrordinary? Not to mention the fact they would get even more publicity and money spewing their way. But the people weren't satisfied, so NASA decided that in 1997, they would go back and capture more.

This would prove to be very difficult for NASA. The rotation of Mars would make it hard to actually land near Cydonia, but in 1998, they did it. The photograph was ten times sharper than the last from 1976. It showed that the formation, was just a formation. Not any ancient artifact. NASA took all that time to prove something that was already proven. Yet few people still were not satisfied.

The people argued that, because it was winter on Mars, it was to cloudy for the camera to take a proper photograph. They thought maybe alien markings were covered by haze. So NASA decided to set off one last time. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second picture, this time with even better cameras. It once again, showed for sure that the landform was nothing but a messa.

One scientist, Jim Garvin, Even compared it to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, trying to help the people understand. NASA whent through so much trouble to prove to the people that it was not life on Mars. So they eventually came to the conclusion that it was just a landform. But there will still always be skeptics.",0.0
e_jr0i07bi,-3,"But as time goes on, scientific knowledge advances, and more data is gathered as we study Venus more closely, enabling us to come to more conclusions. If we were to ignore some of these data, it might be possible that life on Venus would begin even sooner. To the extent that there is ample flowing water on Venus, humans can probably live there. And with these new data, scientists can foresee different outcomes. In spite of the new data, the study of ancient alien civilizations still points to the existence of Earthlike planets a billion years ago, much earlier than the new data would allow, at atmospheric pressures much higher than now, and at temperatures even higher than today. Humans might be able to live there for hundreds or thousands of years, early or midway in the sixth billion, before becoming completely dependent on carbonbased resources when fossil fuel reaches its peak. This means that learning about the ancient history of our planet's current carbon dioxidebased resources might be of great benefit in supplying the very resources that we would need to survive on Venus. Even without that, it might even help us to reduce our dependence on the finite resources available on the planet today by developing alternative sources. Although the alien environment as we know it today may not be sustainable, humans could probably create a humanlike environment on Venus, which might be less harmful than the environment on Earth, where the heat would be too dangerous. However, these studies require a great deal of money, and even NASA admits that it does not have the funds to cover all of the costs of the study. Still, as the author of ""The Challenge of Venus"" states, these studies should be supported by private donations to enable the best exploration without using public funds.",1.0
e_uxhlxat3,-7,"In a society where things are always changing and schedules are always busy cars and other personal motor vehicles have become a necessity. It seems as if cars have become so necessary as all and rendering as such as a imparative to, and water. Many families even have multiple cars in order to get to where the need to go. Even though cars have been so convienient and beneficial for people all over the world there are some factors of cars that produce a negative effect. By eliminating or largly reducing cars usage the world would be a more more ecofriendly and reducing the precious natural gases that the planet provides. For years people have been driving and while most do it safetly some do it recklessly and do not abide by the rules sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving careless driving and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people making many very skeptical or cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in car accidents leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in their place. If cars were to be elimated from the equation all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking riding bicycles taking the bus or subway or even a trolly or ferry there will be an ensured reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind. In addition of increased safety there would also a a significant reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America s carbon emission. If car usage were to be limited or eliminated there would be a noticable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Similarly source one states that Passanger cars are responsible for 12 pecent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. If cars were to be ridden of there would be much less green house gas poluting the atmosphere therefore creating a cleaner environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come. Similarly the removal of cars from the world would mean the preservation of nonrenewable resources. Since cars run on gasoline diesel and other natural gases the resources are being burned up faster than they can replenish themselves. There are other things that rely on the natural gases to work cars included. If cars were to be eliminated and not use the gases at the rapid rate that they do there would be a huge reduction in the usage for fossil fuels therefore preserving the remaining resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future. In conclusion the limitations of car usage would make a significant change in the way the world runs however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter longer and more promising future for the coming generations but it would also relieve stress and worrying and grant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth this would greatly reduce the potential damage that could be done and protect the future. It would provide oppurtunities for a a cleaner atmosphere safer life living in harmony with the ecosystem and a chance to respect and protect the Earth we live on.",0.05
e_cw3hdmid,-1,"Many schools have been offering their students the option to take classes from home through online or video conferencing, however, these schools do not know the real impact this change can have on a students' learning capabilities. Schools should not offer students the option to attend classes from home, because this takes away any chance of them working in a collabrative environnement, recieving guidance from teachers, and learning real life skills that will be used in their future.

In today's newer generations many children and teenagers struggle to grasp the concept of communication. Technology plays a significant role in everyones lives, however, many teenagers are trapped within their phones not being able to experience the real world which impedes them from learning basic oral skills. If schools supply students with the option to take classes from home via online or video conferencing this will further ruin any chance of them ever learning to speak for themselves. School is a collaborative environment that allows students to have a safe space to speak freely and ask questions on subjects they are unsure of, as well as allowing them to socialize and interact with their peers giving them the opportunity to meet new people. Students should not be given the choice whether or not to socialize with other peers they should be given the choice to choose what courses they would like to take School was made for students to learn and grow in a collaborative work environment where they are taught to challenge and interpret knowledge of everyday life, one cannot achieve that level through a computer screen.

Not only will students become static and unchallenged in education if taught through a comptuer screen, they will never be given the chance to have hands on help and guidance from a teacher. One of the most important parts about school is learning how to grow as an overall person while you take in knowledge to help you in your future, but students will never fully be prepared if they never recieved assistance from teachers. Yes people can teach themselves through practicing and reading on a specific subject, however, they would have one essential piece missing from their skills and that is guidance passed down from one to another. When students are in school they are being prepared for the real world where they will have to use all the knowledge and skills learned over the years to succeeed, in doing so, they will not be left in the dust while others recieve promotions and start successful businesses.

However, if students stay home and attend their classes through video conferencing what skills will they learn to give them an advantage in the real world, how will they ever know when to apply the information learned in school? If these students choose to go to college and get a doctoral or bachelors degree, they will once again be left behind, because when they were infront of their computer screen seven hours a day the only information they attained was how to type fast and memorize information. This is why attending school is an essential part of a students life, because they are given the opportunities to grow and retain information that is essential for a successful future.

School is a safe place for students to grow and discover hobbies that one day will play a major rule in their careers. However, many schools are adopting a new option of learning i. e. online classes that can be attended from a students home. These schools do not know the true impact this option can have on a students learning capabilities. Many students will blindly chose to take courses from home because they will not have to worry about personal hygine and communication with others. In doing so, many of these students will be stripped away of any opportunities such as guidance from teachers, collaboration with fellow peers, and experience for their future.",0.0
e_gh41u9tr,0,"Have you ever thought about the advsantages of limiting car usage and as well as giving up cars inorder to help the communities out there to live a better safisticated life, without the use of cars?. A plan created called smart planning involves the reduce or car usage helping the world also reduce bad pollution, and traffic jams. This way more transportation will be provided for other cases or people in need of that. In Germany, Paris, Bogota and the United States there are many reasons being caused to reducing cars due to jepordise it can cause such as pollution, traffic jams, space and transportation. In all these countries there are the different reasons to why cars should be banned.

To begin with, in Germany a district in Freiburg near the French ans Swiss borders cars have been givin up by people. Pepole are claiming to be more happy with their newly lifestyle of not using a car. Before they were using a car they also claimed that everything had felt more tense. Now that cars are banned in the district there has been more free space for pedestrians to walk. There has been more availabale roads and stress that are not packed anymore. There is space to build. Before cars had taken control over the roads and stress not proving areas and space to walk in. Middle class were choking cities meaning that their Cars were just taking way too much space. Cars are responsible for the greenhouse. Knowing that passanger cars are also reposible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas. protection agencies are promoting car reduce as well as communities that are less dependent on cars. Vauban's streets are car free. 70 percent of vaubans families are also car free. The driveways, street parking and garages are all fobidden in that district.

However, Paris has faced another jepordising problem due to smog. Paris has been known to have the most smog than the rest of the European capitals. Due to this problem cars have been banned in order to clear the air pollution causing danger. This bad pollution can lead to sickness, weather changes that are bad and may cause people to inhale bad oxygen. People were commanded to leave their license plates at home or risk to pay a 22 euro fine that equals to 31 dollars in American money. So far 4,000 people have paid this fine for not following this law. With this progress the pollution has cleared from Paris and has now gone to another place.

Innitially, traffic jams are a common problem in our everyday life. In Bogota, they face traffic jams and pollution. For this cause the citizens of Bogota have banned the usage of cars only allowing busses and taxis to be used. They have placed transportation instead of cars. People whp violate these rules are permitted to to pay a 25 dollar fine. The reduce of cars in Bogota has helped clear the roads and make a dramastic change that has to do with the traffic jams they had been facing. Since there has been so much rain every single day in Bogota the air pollution has been reduced. People who visited Bogota had been mesmerized to the changes there has been of less pollution and traffic jams. Seeing the country all coaporate in this change.

Therefor, in the United states there has been a change of people reducing the use of cars. There has been a reduce in miles driven due to people who cant afford getting a car or paying for one. Childrens have not bothered to get a license because they had started to use bycicles, walking and transportation to get to their destination. There has been a major drop of 16 to 39 years old that didn't bother getting their license. Creating car pools is one of the greates way to reduce car usage. Communication also plays a role in this change. Having cell phones and communicating more with freinds would not always require driving. Although transportation also has its cons to car industry. A buisness plan has been made in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.

In conclusion, countries have faced big problems due to all these causes of car usage. People had given up their cars and are now using transportaion, walking and Bycicles has helped get rid of all these problems countries were facing. People have decided to coaporate and help make a change has made an amazing progress. People from other countries have also been amazed seeing this change and mabey will also decided to apply this to their country for their safety. Now that cars have been reduced and transportation is provided in Germany, Paris, France, Bogota and the United States,pollution, traffic jams, space and transportation had all been solved.",0.0

e_1hl0ti8m,1,"Abolishing the Electoral College

This process is only used for the presidental election source 1, by congress and the President by popular vote. This is a process, that the founding fathers created, but which process should be abolished. This has caused some major problems with the system of electing the president, but if we were able to remove this from the government, then the United States would be a better place.

The system that we have today is just a waste of time. The Americans should choose who they want to represent them in the election, because the citizens of the United States have the choice to elect them. Electors are the people who do the voting. When they go to the Presidential Election they give them the power to do whatever they think it's should be. There is no reason to keep an elector who can not do his or hers jobs. This is not fair. In source 2 Paragraph 22. Posner stated that ""If someone did that, you'd get a much larger chance of getting elected."" The people would get to control thier future.

Next, the People of our free world should choose the President and Vice President directly. For instance, when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFLCIO voted for Jhon Kerry, we had to vote on him. This shows that our government should be responsible for deciding who tries to do things, and we shouldn't have to trust someone we may not even know.

I strongly believe that we should get rid of this process. This process is not as reliable as we think and it is just not trustworthy. We the people have the choice to do this for the President and Vice President. That's why most people choose to elect a president from their own hand rather than the electors.",0.7

e_76luxk03,5,"Finally, the Facial Action Coding System may seem advanced and effective, but relying solely on technology to understand the emotions of students in a classroom may not be the best solution.

The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" discusses the use of the Facial Action Coding System FACS as a tool for computers to identify human emotions. While some may argue that utilizing this technology in a classroom setting can be valuable, I believe that it is not a practical solution and may potentially cause more harm than good.

Firstly, the use of FACS in a classroom setting is unnecessary. As humans, we are capable of reading and interpreting the emotions of others through their actions and facial expressions. We do not need a ""robot"" to tell us how someone is feeling in a particular moment. Moreover, relying solely on technology to understand the emotional state of students in a classroom may not be accurate. People are complex beings and can easily fake emotions, making it difficult for technology to provide an accurate interpretation.

Furthermore, using this technology would require a significant amount of investment in terms of both time and money. The technology itself is expensive and would require multiple units to be used in a classroom setting. This would be a waste of resources that could be better utilized for other purposes within the education system.

Additionally, the article mentions that even though individuals may show varying levels of expression, the software is able to track subtle facial movements. However, this may not always be the case. Some individuals may be able to control their facial expressions, making it difficult for the technology to accurately identify their true emotions. This brings into question the reliability and effectiveness of using FACS in a classroom setting.

Moreover, the end goal of using this technology is to somehow improve a student's emotional state, similar to how looking at the Mona Lisa can bring a smile to one's face. However, as the article states, even the famous painting may not have the same impact on everyone. Each individual is unique and what may bring joy to one person may not have the same effect on another. Therefore, relying on the technology to improve a person's emotional state may not be a practical solution.

Lastly, the use of FACS in the classroom may have negative consequences as well. Some individuals may purposely manipulate their facial expressions to garner attention or manipulate the results of the technology. This could create a disruptive environment and take away from the purpose of using FACS in the first place.

In conclusion, while the idea of using technology to understand the emotions of students in a classroom may seem beneficial, it is not a practical solution. It is more important for teachers and other individuals within the education system to actively engage with students and have private conversations to address their emotional wellbeing. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words, and in this case, human interaction is more valuable than relying solely on the use of technology. So, I believe that implementing FACS in the classroom may be a waste of resources and may potentially cause more harm than good.",1.0
e_zigz9tsf,5,"However, there is value in using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. This technology can provide valuable insights into student behavior and help educators better understand how their students are feeling. With this information, teachers can tailor their teaching methods and approaches to best support their students' learning and wellbeing.

Additionally, the use of FACS in the classroom can create a more inclusive and understanding environment. Students who may have difficulty expressing their emotions verbally can benefit from this technology as it can accurately interpret their emotional state. This can lead to a more supportive and empathetic atmosphere in the classroom, as teachers can use this information to provide the necessary support and accommodations for their students.

Moreover, by using FACS in the classroom, students can also learn about emotional intelligence and the importance of understanding and managing their emotions. This can lead to better social and emotional skills, which are essential for success in both academic and personal life.

Furthermore, the potential applications of FACS in the classroom extend beyond just identifying basic emotions. It can also be used to detect signs of stress, anxiety, and other emotional states that could affect a student's learning and wellbeing. With this information, teachers can intervene and provide proper support to their students, promoting a more positive and healthy learning environment.

In conclusion, while some may argue that the use of FACS in a classroom is unnecessary, it can hold great value in improving student wellbeing and academic success. With proper implementation and ethical considerations, this technology can be a valuable tool in creating a more supportive, inclusive, and emotionally intelligent learning environment. Therefore, I believe that using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is indeed valuable and should be considered for implementation in educational settings.",1.0

I'm writing you this letter to address and give you my opinion onthe argument about keeping the clectoral college or changing to election by popular vote fhor the president of the United States.

I feel that we should remove the electoral college because it seems like we do not use all of the votes to have everyone's input on the election. The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. My question is ""Why not use all of the electors votes instead of using only anout 55% of them?"". We say that every vote counts but if we are not using all of the electoral votes then that means we are just contradicting our statement.

From articles I have read, Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the resident. Let's say if you lived in Texas, for instance , and wanted to vote for Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. Voters can not always control whom their vote for and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and choose the wrong canidate. Some people may say that electoral votes should be kept so that it would make it easier for them but i feel thatelectoral votes are confusing and should be removed from a process of electing the president.",0.0

Would it be your fault that you didnt fix it before it started to do something bad or would it be their fault that the car didn t work. What if someone didn t realize that they had to work on the car before using. I think the car shouldn t be on the road because what if someone didnt realize they had to look at it. They could be coming up and a ungodly out of the car and not think that they have to be in the car so they could know their not something wrong with it. I know the driverless car would be cool too it can tell when a person is falling asleep. But how many people will actually use one? How much would they spend? All the new technology would be a new war that would be to to the car. I really don t think that we are ready for a car that can drive itself that easily. So thats why i think we shouldn t have cars that can do everything for you just because you don t have to do it. That is not how the world shoudle work.

I joined the program for many reasons. I joined because I have a really good friend named Don Reist. He talked to me about how they do things there and how much fun it is. So I thought, if I went and was serving people and helping them survive, would it be good for me, and then I knew that God was calling me to do this and I wanted to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, so I said, ""Yes.""

Once I got there, I heard that there were 44 nations and that we were going to form UNRRA, wich meant, the United Nations Relief nd Rehabilation Administration. Don and I had signed up for the ""Seagoing Cowboys,"" where you take care all of the animals. It wasnt what I had expected, but it was still something that I could serve God for.

e_b78tpirv,4,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" i think its not good to have a tv in the car because its a distraction to the driver. If you have kids they might be laughing, screaming and doing other stuff that can distract you when driving. It is helpful for the car to be able to drive while the parent is taking care of there kids. It's okay to have Google maps and stuff like that to help you out.

Sensors are good because they could help you out when your not paying attention or when something is coming and you dont see it coming. They can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which can allow the car to slow down quickly.

BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant the car can handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the friver keeps hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless, they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they are desighned to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing incar entertainment and information systems that use heads up displays. Which can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. In this way, the incar system is acutally a safety feature.

Driving laws are focus on keeping the driver, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If we have this then, i think that it will help us out. The reason for this is because we wouldnt be focused on reading our texts, or anything like that. We know that our car can drive on its own.

I think it would be smart to have this in our car. It would help us out in the long run. It would keep the other drivers safe if we didnt have to worry so much about everything.",0.0

Do you really know how many people vote for a certain person in the White House? Not all of you know, but i beleive that the Electoral College may be the right thing to do for the president of the United States. Many people in American think that if we changed the voting system to popular vote people would vote for the president. They might be in favor in putting the trust of the person to make the correct decision for our country. The Electoral College is good for certain reasons, like the winnertakesall system.

If the people of the United States wanted to abolish the Electoral College then their would be big problems like in Source 2 in Source 2 it says ""It has 538 electors, but they only get 3 electoral votes."" This means that there isn't a clear winner on what the people of America want. Some of the things that the electoral college doesnt do is the fact that they are not in favor. If the Electoral College would go to popular vote it would make the voting system easier, and to be able to choose who we want to run to win the elections.

There is always the possiblitiy that there would be a tie, and if that were to happen what would happen to the president of the United States. In the passage it says that they ""Can voters control whom their vote for?"" If the people of America wanted to vote it would be more fair to let the popular vote decide who becomes the president. When people vote they think that the Electoral College should go beacuse they don't pay attention to the voters and see who is really in the White House,and if it's one of them they will get the big states and that will help them win the election.

This is just a simple way to vote for the president but to change to election by popular vote would be much better then voting by Electoral College.",0.7

e_87f9d3tt,-2,"Creationism is a religious dogma about the creation of the world based on the Bible. This movement is often described as an offshoot of science, and articles are passed off as scientific and peerreviewed. However, creationism does not meet the criteria of the scientific method of knowledge  basing conclusions on facts rather than faith. A scientist can only hypothesize about some new entity if there is sufficient reason to do so that cannot be explained by the existing theory and not because of religious faith. Nevertheless, creationists are not bothered by their lack of a scientific method. In this paper, I would like to review one such article. Although it has its share of factual information, most of its arguments do not stand up to criticism. The article The image of God by Genesis File seeks to disprove Darwins theory of evolution and prove that life on earth was created by external intelligence 2021. The authors main arguments against evolution are the growth of molecular chaos and the scarcity of transitional forms in the annals of fossils, which supposedly contradict Darwins theory of evolution. In my article I will examine these arguments in sequence and highlight their main point. Then, I will use evidencebased science to refute these contentions. In conclusion, I will summarize all the deficiencies in the evidence and make recommendations on how to improve them.
The first flaw in the articles argument is that throughout the entire existence of the species homo sapiens, not a single mutation into other species has been observed. This argument cannot be accepted as valid because it manipulates the facts. The fact is that this argument is cited as proof that an organism cannot change its form and evolve into other species on its own. It argues in favor of the fact that early organisms could not evolve from natives into amphibians and then into mammalian creatures Genesis File, 2021. However, the author of the article does not consider that at the time of life of the first organisms, the conditions on our planet were dramatically different from those of today. Floods, droughts, and ice ages occurred. To survive, organisms had to go through massive changes. Nor should we forget that these changes took place over millions of years. However, the articles author argues that since none of them evolved further over the last few hundred thousand years of modern homo sapiens existence, the whole theory of evolution is flawed Genesis File, 2021. Changes in the species occurred and are still happening, just quite slowly. For example, primitive humans had a different physique they had a more powerful, broader, and shorter chest than modern humans Jantsch, 2019. These changes were due to the optimization of the respiratory system, which gave humans the ability to run long distances and other types of endurance. Another argument to refute the article argues that our species has been around for a relatively short time relative to those that have undergone more striking evolution. This means that we may not yet have achieved a notable change due to lack of time and may well be transformed into another form in the course of unceasing evolution.
The second flaw in the articles argument is that primitive organisms could never have evolved into humans. The paper justifies this by saying that a cell contains a specific genetic code and can only be subject to small adaptive changes Genesis File, 2021. Thus, the author argues that a unicellular organism cannot evolve into a multicellular organism. Furthermore, a unicellular organism cannot develop into a multicellular organism on its own. According to the author, for more striking evolution, the intervention of an intelligent being is necessary. The example of human birth can refute this argument. Man, a complex multicellular organism with consciousness, is born from the fusion of two unicellular organisms, the male sperm and the female testicle Jantsch, 2019. This is an irrefutable experimental fact. As one can see, the process of human birth from unicellular microorganisms exists in nature and in no way needs divine intervention. Thus, a multicellular organism can emerge from a singlecelled organism. Furthermore, when a new human being is born, evolution repeats the entire path from unicellulars to humans. Development is essentially chemically the same as the birth of a human being the process is just greatly extended in time. This is precisely how it happened  from unicellular emerged multicellular. Another example can also illustrate this. Speciation due to acts of natural selection takes place today in a completely natural way without the slightest divine intervention. Sometimes even despite human intervention  for example, many species of pathogenic bacteria are regularly poisoned with antibiotics. Many bacteria die, but new antibioticresistant bacteria emerge because of the pressure of natural selection, and not even hundreds of years have passed.
Another flaw in the articles argument is the citation of the lack of transitional forms in the annals of the fossil record as a fact in favor of the absence of evolution. Creationists believe that development has always proceeded simultaneously and assumed many transitional forms must have been Genesis File, 2021. If there were no transitional forms, there was no evolution. To refute this argument is worth highlighting how evolution proceeded. The evolutionary transition from one species to another occurs only when natural selection is under pressure. The factor causing the stress of natural selection is not constant, so evolutionary transitions are also discontinuous Jantsch, 2019. As an example, consider the transition between fish and amphibians. As long as fish lived in the water and had enough food to survive there, there was no pressure of natural selection to bring them onto land in search of food. However, this selection pressure arose from the depletion of food and increased competition in the water on the one hand and the abundance of food and lack of competition on land on the other Dror, 2020.
Those fish with slightly larger fins could occasionally feed near the ground and lay eggs there. Therefore, after one generation, the descendants of this population in these conditions had slightly longer fins. In the next generation, there were even longer fins. So, every year in the coastal fish population, fish with larger and larger fins survive and reproduce. After another few hundred years, they developed some semblance of paws. As a result, it turns out that the evolutionary transition is very fast by geological standards  only a few generations, not millions of years. Consequently, evolution took place by such rapid leaps caused by the variable pressure of natural selection, which varied depending on natural conditions  differences in resources and the level of competition in flora and fauna. This explains the scarcity of transitional forms in the fossil record.
In conclusion, while many creationist articles are considered scientific, they contain many flaws in their reasoning. The main weaknesses were manipulating facts, dismissing a critical treatment of arguments, and the lack of a theoretical basis. Consequently, the author erroneously argued that the species homo sapiens is incapable of evolution and that a singlecelled organism cannot transform into a multicellular organism on its own. To improve the argument, I advise the author to read scientific articles presenting an alternative view. This will help make the ideas more comprehensive and align with current scientific evidence.",0.0
e_v1m3amsj,0,"In this passage it is giving you information about Vauban's people, they do not use a car as transportation. In paragraph 3 Heidrun Walter states,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" so an advantage of limiting car usage would be, that you are happier. Vauban in 2006, was an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. Did you know passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintesive areas in the United States. With all that gas from the cars that is just causing more polution. Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessibleto public transportation, with less space for parking. In Vauban they are saying that they want to make walking to a bussiness or shoping center closer so they don't have to walk as far. Another reason why limiting car usage is a good idea, is that if you walk you get exercise which helps your body not just the Earth. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. I believe that we should change those numbers around, and have more people doing what Vauban, Germany is doing and walking or riding bikes to the places we want to go.",0.0

Computer Associates International Inc. announced today that it is updating its technology offerings to manage critical IT infrastructure.  The company will extend its Unicenter systems management software to newer platforms like Microsoft's .Net framework and also strengthen ties with Microsoft and several other technology companies.

Unicenter, CA's flagship systems management software, has long been used to monitor and control things like security, storage, and performance of servers, networks, and applications in data centers.  However, as companies have started using newer technologies like cloud computing, virtualization, and Web services, Unicenter required updates to manage these environments.  

CA has now enhanced Unicenter to manage systems running on Microsoft's .Net platform and also platforms from VMware, IBM, and others.  The company announced partnerships with Microsoft, VMware, and IBM where the companies will work together on product development and also crosssell each other's software.  CA believes these moves will allow its customers to use Unicenter to manage both legacy mainframe systems as well as newer distributed systems, virtualized servers, and cloud platforms.

The partnerships with other technology vendors also signals a change in strategy for CA.  Once known more as a mainframe software company, CA has been working to establish itself as a broader systems management software provider for companies using hybrid IT environments.  The company believes that with its large installed customer base of mainframe users, it is well positioned to crosssell more modern tools for managing newer platforms and virtualized systems.

While some analysts view these moves as a good step forward, others argue that CA may be late in offering true hybrid and cloud management capabilities.  Competitors like BMC, HP, and IBM have tools that already work across numerous virtualization, cloud and traditional platforms.  Still, with its focus on systems management and partnerships with leading tech companies, CA hopes these latest Unicenter and strategy updates will make it a viable provider of management software for the modern enterprise data center.",1.0

I think community service should be mandatory from all students. they're are many reasons why i think so. first of all community service teaches responsibility. it shows you that there are other things in life that are more important than you. you begin to realize that it is not all about you. you also learn how to plan your day smartly, and you learn how to use your time wisely. you may have community service for an hour let's say. it will help you decide when to do other chores or tasks that you have so that you can make time to go do community service. these skills will help you a lot when you get older because you always have work or something important to do. community service helps you stay organized. most importantly, doing community service helps you realize the problems we have within society. it helps you be considerate because you are helping a lot in community service. if you are picking up litter from somewhere you realize that the environment is in need because it is dirty and this can cause many problems. community service helps you appreciate the other and greater things in life. even if you or another person think community service is boring or it is a waste of time, believe it or no there is still benefit to it. if you think of community service is just another hardship in your life, then still do it. i' m saying this because when you get older you will face a lot of tough situations where sometimes you wish you were not even alive. thinking of community service as a hardship and still doing will toughen you up a bit so that when you get older you can endure those hard times better. now let's say you are doing community service where you are teaching other people something whether it be education or some special skill, this is very beneficial as well. you will learn that it is good to be considerate of others and putting them before you. it will show you that it is good to come to others needs and helping them. it is good to be concerned with others and how they are doing. if you have these habits, when you get older you'll have a lot of friends and a lot of people will like you. And who knows, maybe some people may begin to look up to you and go as far as try to look up to you. also, once you do the actual work or community service, you feel good and proud about yourself afterwards. you feel good that you helped someone or the environment. once my dad told me to go pick up some garbage that was laying around and i did not want to but i did it any way. afterwards i felt kind of good about my self because i helped the environment.",0.0
e_wqtl3wuy,4,"The driverless cars has been an idea that has been around for many years. The thought of not having to waste energy in driving and to make the experience more relaxing for the individual. It seems like a dream that could finally become a reality with the advancements in technology. However there will be many different people who will wish to insult and bring down the idea of the driverless cars. Not everyone will be on board with this change because it is new and can be seen as a threat to the traditional way of driving and the jobs related to it. It will also start to corrupt our natural human abilities. What happens when we rely too much on technology and it fails us? We might lose our driving skills and become too dependent on these autonomous vehicles. Eventually this could lead to problems if the technology is not perfect. One thing to note I am not entirely against automation or self seficient machinery. However how could we say that we are hard working individuals when a robot will be doing the work for us? Could we really trust a machine to make splitsecond decisions that could mean life or death?

One major concern is the safety of these driverless cars. There have been instances where the technology has failed and caused accidents. Numerous states have already opposed the idea and plan to keep it that way until the cars are proven reliable. In addition, if traffic laws change new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Waiting for these questions to be answered is crucial.

The conclusion is that the technology is not yet perfect. The ideas are good and can be benificial in the future but lets take our time and make shure that these driverless cars can actually drive themselves. It is difficult to say when these will be done but when they are I hope that it will be avalible for everyone.",0.3790902731485908
e_07dnzh0j,0,"In the world today, people drive less and less for many different reasons, such as, walking, riding a bike, taking buses to work, shopping, and other methods of transportation. Getting to places is something you must get used to, but it is not so much as you can think of as the way to get places. The advantages of limiting car usage are that it promotes alternative forms of transportation and it is a safer environment, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

One positive effect of less cars is the improvement of other forms of transportation. The use of cars has also increased greatly in recent years. According to Richard A. Posner in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it states that in the year of 2005, the number of car usage per year has dropped. ""It drved the inventors of the future to explore a way to move to places that were accustomed to walking and biking, as did Sergey Brin. Since then, he has adapted his carpooling ideas into public traspotation...and that will help develop and encourage more people to not drive cars.

Another major advantage of limiting the use of cars is the reduction of air pollution. During carfree day, the air is polluted by cars, which has a huge impact on the amount of greenhouse gas in our environment, because of how much we use our vehicles, and if it is dangerous to us. ""In Vauban, Germany, residents of an experimental community, where middleclass families with young childrens' homes, have given up their automobiles. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined 31 according to Reuters"". This means that people with less cars are not using cars to travel to work, but they are less worried about smog and getting fines by the police. For example, police officers say that they will only let their kids use cars when they need to do so because they do not have to worry about what people are saying. Another example of limiting the use of cars is the way to go.

Overall, To sum up, reducing the use of cars is a good idea. By promoting other forms of transportation, it requries less gas emissions and lowers air pollution, which is just what we need and should be done when we want to limit our usage. Cars have been in us for many years and there are numerous reasons why people are using cars and why we should limit their use. But limiting car usage is beneficial to everyone in this world who uses cars.",0.7
e_beq4u399,6,"In the passage The challenge of exploring venus the author talks about the studying of venus and it s worthy pursuit despite its danger. The author makes a compelling argument for the scientific exploration of Venus. He provides detailed information about the planet and the challenges it presents.
While Venus is often called Earth's ""twin,"" it is a very different and hostile environment. The planet's surface is incredibly hot and the atmosphere is toxic, which makes it difficult to explore.
The author explains that Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid. The surface temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hotter than Mercury, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Which makes it a very challenging place to send spacecraft. Although it is the closest planet from earth the passage states that not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Venus is 800 degrees Fahrenheit and a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. That means that any spacecraft that attempts to land there would have to withstand extreme conditions that could destroy it.
The author states that These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.
The author is saying that yes earth is dangerous and that we could die here but going to venus is a bigger risk and could kill everyone that went. But despite these risks, scientists are still interested in studying Venus. If they survive they would be able to tell us what equitment we would need to go back up there and study safely.
If our sister planet is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? The author is stating that scientist are putting peoples lifes in danger and are not finding diffrent way to study this planet. The author also states that The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive? The author is simply asking if they will try and come up with a safer way to study venus than just keep sending people up who obviously are not going to make it.
NASA has been studying different and safer way to study Venus. It has proposed using blimplike vehicles to float above the planet's surface. In the passage it states For example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. This supports the author by saying that the challenges are bad but there is also can also be a solution is people try hard enough. It shows that with innovation and determination, studying Venus could be possible.",0.3160524427912519

There is also an inportant nasa story that shows that Luke is the reason Luke convinced people to go out there and they also talk about the place where he lived. It also is an experiance I think Luke and his friend should go and take care of animals like the viking 1 and 2 with him.

e_88tvmlo2,4,"What do you think about when you think of the future? Do you think that driveless cars would be the end result of being safe? Driveless cars are not safe because it makes people lazy, gets rid of all driving laws, and technology isn't always as great as we think it is.

The world is already lazy, so why would you want to make it more lazy? We already have machines, computers, and phones doing everything for us. Machines make everyday things but people get paid so much for pressing a button. Computers do everything for us. Phones answer all our questions. Now cars are going to be driving themselves. And what are the people going to do? Sit back and watch. Then all we will be doing is having everything do it for us and we do nothing.

Not only will the people be lazy, then there will not be laws like there is today. What is someone gets hurt? Who are you going to blame it on? People do what they do and how they do it for a reason. If people want to drunk drive and drive high then they should be punished for the bad things they do and not have a car doing everything for them and be as if it's a way out of trouble.

Now that there isn't much laws and we have robots doing everything for us there is only one thing we depend on. That is technology. Technology isn't the greatest. Have you ever got mad while being on a computer or a phone? Why is that? It's because technology didn't work as well that day. What are you going to do when you're in a driveless car and it decides to just stop? You're going to get hurt. Now you're hurt and no one is reliable because we thought technology was the greatest thing.

All in all, driveless cars are not safe for today's society. They are not safe because it makes people lazy, laws will be cut in half, and technology doesn't always work. We're here to make something of our lives and not have technology do everything for us. So go out and have a life.",0.0
e_h2od7sxx,5,"The value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions is an extremely smart idea. They see if they were confused or not. This software could help kids understand their assignments easier, explain more things throughly, and break the subject down into smaller sections.

The way that this software could help kids understand their assignments easier is that it could read their emotions while they're taking notes and the teacher says something they don't understand. The software could then read that emotion of confusion and show them a simplier way to understand it. Thus making the lesson easier to understand so they could actually do their work right instead of doing it completely wrong.

Another way that this software could help students understand things better is that it could explain more throughly. For example, a student could be sitting in math class and taking notes. The kid might not understand what the teacher means as he's talking about a specific formula. The software could reconigze the look and explain it better to the sudent so that they understand what they meant.

The last reason why this software could be useful is that it could break down in the lesson into smaller sections. A kid could be completely lost on what he's learning about in science and they're overwhelmed by everything together. The program could reconigze the confusion of the kid. It could then break the whole lesson apart and explain it one step at a time so could make more sense to them.

In conclusion, this software could do amazing things to help students understand and comprehend a lesson better than anything else. While this program will probably never be available for my education, it would be amazing asset for future students. The software could make it easier for assignments to be understood, explain a lesson further than the teacher did, and break lessons down into smaller sections. This software is the future for our world's education.",0.0
e_602nu5s6,3,"In this story about a cowboy who rode the waves I think he did that because he wanted to travel around the world and see new things. I say this because if you read in the story it says "" Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after high school graduation"". This means when luke was done with highschool he decided to go on this adventure of going to different places and seeing new things. It also said ""he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime"", this shows that even though this is something that happened long ago, some people might still feel like they are getting a chance at being able to do something fun and be able to travel around the country or maybe even the world! The next thing that i will talk about is in this stroy it tells us how we can do many things during our free time. For example, this quote from paragraph 4, it says""besides helping out the animals, Luke got to take care of himself by doing other jobs such as nightwatching.""This shows that not only does traveling around the world sound cool but there are things for you to do while your doing it so you dont get bored. Another reason why i am writing about this storry is that this sounds like a good way to find friends and learn more stuff about whats happening in the world today. If you look back to paragraph 2 it states,""Besides taking trips, you could hangout with people you meet along your journey and make new freinds"".

e_e5h7gl6d,-2,"U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis began talks with Chinese officials on Wednesday to address issues related to arms proliferation, marking a significant step in the two countries' cooperative efforts to maintain peace and stability worldwide.
The discussions, which are expected to continue for several days, will focus on a wide range of topics related to the proliferation of arms, including Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs, cybersecurity, missile defense, and other issues of mutual concern.
""The United States and China recognize the importance of working together to address the challenges posed by the proliferation of arms,"" said Davis in a statement released ahead of the talks. ""We look forward to engaging in productive discussions with our Chinese counterparts on these issues, which are critical to the security of our two nations and the world as a whole.""
The talks come as tensions between the U.S. and China have been on the rise in recent months over a range of issues, including trade and human rights, prompting fears of a new Cold War.
However, both sides have emphasized the importance of maintaining a constructive dialogue on issues of mutual concern, including arms proliferation, and have expressed hope that the talks will help to improve ties between the two countries.
China, which is the world's largest arms exporter, has been under increasing pressure from the U.S. and other countries to curtail its weapons sales to countries with poor human rights records, such as Iran and North Korea.
However, China has defended its arms exports as legitimate and necessary for its own defense, and has criticized the U.S. for what it sees as hypocritical policies on arms proliferation.
""We hope that the U.S. will respect China's sovereignty and security interests, and work with us in a constructive and mutually beneficial way to address the challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons,"" said a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Despite these differences, both sides have indicated a willingness to work together on arms proliferation issues, and have expressed a desire to find common ground.
""We have many shared interests and concerns, and we believe that by working together, we can make progress on these important issues,"" said Davis.
The talks are part of a wider effort by the U.S. and China to improve ties and address areas of conflict, in what many see as a crucial period for the geopolitical balance of power.
Both sides have emphasized the need for dialogue and cooperation, even as they continue to pursue their own interests and assert their own values on the world stage.
""The United States and China may have different ideologies and political systems, but we share a common interest in promoting peace and stability,"" said Davis. ""We are committed to continuing this dialogue and finding ways to work together for the good of both our countries and the world.",1.0
e_kb5r17wq,-2,"The Holocaust and its ramifications have been at the center of much controversy and debate. The nature of radical evil as exhibited by the Holocaust  challenges our fundamental understanding of morality and ethics. Two key thinkers who have grappled with the philosophical implications of the Holocaust are Zygmunt Bauman and Hannah Arendt. Bauman adopts the view that the Holocaust represented a form of ""radical evil"" that transcended normal moral and ethical reasoning. In contrast, Arendt argued that the Holocaust showed the ""banality of evil""  that morally questionable acts can be perpetrated by ordinary individuals following orders and social conventions. These contrasting views raise important questions about human nature, morality, and the role of modern institutions.

Bauman sees the Holocaust as an act of ""radical evil"" that defied normal moral reasoning and constraints. The systematic, bureaucratized, and industrialized nature of the mass murder meant that normal ethical considerations were suspended. The moral norms that usually govern individual behavior were overridden by ideological indoctrination and a culture where following orders was valued over individual conscience. For Bauman, the Holocaust showed how civilization can descend into barbarism when moral reasoning is divorced from human action. This ""radical evil"" emerged from a loss of individual moral responsibility.

In contrast, Arendt put forth the idea of the ""banality of evil."" She argued that the Holocaust was perpetrated not by sociopaths or monsters, but by ordinary individuals following orders in a bureaucratic system. Moral reasoning was subsumed to social expectations about following rules and orders. Arendt contends that evil acts are not always committed by evil people, but can emerge from the failure to reflect upon the moral consequences of one's actions. The ""banality of evil"" concept suggests that moral reasoning is often secondary to obedience and conformity in hierarchical organizations and societies. 

The diverging views of Bauman and Arendt thus raise important questions about human nature, morality, and society. How did moral reasoning fail on such a massive scale? Was the Holocaust a result of a breakdown in typical moral thinking as Bauman argues, or did it emerge from the ordinary human tendency to follow orders without reflection as Arendt posits? Can such moral catastrophes be prevented by promoting individual conscience over conformity? Or will they continue to haunt modern societies as the dark side of order, efficiency, and progress? These questions remain deeply relevant today as we grapple with moral complexity in an increasingly technocratic world.

In conclusion, the Holocaust gave rise to radically different interpretations of radical and banal evil that remain controversial while offering essential insights. Analysis of these philosophical perspectives yields important lessons about morality, society and human nature that we must continue to reckon with in order to build a better future. Overall, the Holocaust reminds us of the moral obligation to cultivate an ethic of individual conscience and moral courage against the pull of ideological extremism or bureaucratic conformity. This is a sobering message for modernity.",1.0
e_mo9t98mn,-1,"Dear Principal:

I would consider Policy 1 being a commendable option too the students and teachers.

There can be emergencies and family health issues a student would need be notified of during school time. I'm sure this would be good and there would be no problems. Students need cell phones by their side in case something happens in school and they need get in touch with a parent or relative. Also, there can be a bus situation when you need your cell phone in the process. Cell phones shouldn't be a big deal. Teachers use their cell phones when they want , and when they need make important calls. Therefore, students using theirs shouldn't be a problem. They need it as much as the teacher do. Policy 2, well not a very good choice. If you was too set this rule and say students couldn't bring their cell phones to school , more than likely some students would bring them anyway. For example: you can't bring your cell phone to school and something bad happens, and you need get in touch with your parent as soon as possible. What can you do? Nothing at all , but wait around for a teacher or an adult too get in touch with the parent. Not smart at all, considering that your life is in danger. Principal, think about the consequences and the trouble it can cause, by not allowing students too bring they phones at school. It's not effecting the school nor the people in it. My opinion is to go for Policy 1. You won't have too worry about taking phones away because they not allowed or fussing with a student because they refuse. As long as the students don't use their cell phones in class, then it shouldn't be a problem. Think about it and see which is best, I gave you my opinion. Now it's all up too you and what you consider best for your students.",0.0

He already knew what he wanted to do: become a doctor.However, he has been trying to decide what kind of doctor he wants to be.Therefore, he decided to conduct some research on various types of doctors before entering high school.After careful consideration, Generic_name decided that he wanted to be a surgeon.He took all the necessary courses, became one, and finally realized becoming a surgeon, making a lot of money, living in a beautiful house, and enjoying the goal of the best life he dreamed of Dream.In some society, I hope that students will determine their occupations when entering high school.Personally, I believe that students should be engaged in occupation when entering high school.There are several important reasons.

The first reason is that it allows students to have the opportunity to understand the specific requirements and expectations of their selected occupations.For example, in order to become a doctor, you need to take a specific scientific lesson and pass some exams.By determining their occupation as soon as possible, students can plan their courses and take necessary steps to meet these requirements.In the long run, this can save their time and energy and help them achieve their goals more effectively.

The second reason is that it reduces stress and anxiety.When students know what they want to do, they can focus their energy on achieving their goals and avoid many choices they can use.They can also seek the guidance and support of teachers, mentors and peers, which can help them maintain their track and achieve their goals.

Some people may argue that they can wait until future life to determine occupation.They may think that when high school is exploring, students should have freedom to change their minds and pursue different interests.Although this may be correct, you may feel stress and time to figure out what you want to do in the future.By determining the occupation as soon as possible, students can have a clear direction and concentrate their energy on achieving their goals.

In short, I think it is important for students to occupy when entering high school.",1.0

e_mmv3abgj,1,"The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up it takes votes away from people, It changes the votes to make a person lose presidency even by changing the senators, and it's a winner take all system these dont turn out good no matter what. It's even overthrowing the people with the popular vote yes it sadly is possible.

Why would you still have the electoral college if it doesnt help anyone at all?

There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. The odds of one side winnning is easily changed with electoral votes. This inturrupts the odds of how much the people likes them then it turns into how much the government of states likes them. However it could help some people win if they are not the popular vote.

It can also make anyone with the popular vote lose when they should have won like after Al Gore during the gallup poll thanks to the perks of the electoral college won the popular vote but he lost presidency over it. Even though 60% of people prefer the direct election now some prefer the electoral college.

But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it. A good arguement was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would appose John F. Kenedy"" that is just evil. Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made.

Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state. They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate exept for Maine and Nebraska it is being used for what they are using it for.

In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win. Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far.",0.0
e_s1taqtnf,5,"The newest technology called the facial recognition. The author suggests that the technology used for the creation of the Mona Lisa is a piece of technology that was once used by Leonardo da Vinci. Nevertheless, this technology is actually capable of detecting facial expressions. In paragraph 2 the author is talking about how this technolohy has developed and enables it to be used in the classroom. Technology has advanced quite significantly over the past few years, and with all the technology it has now it's possible that it will have a positive outcome in the coming years.

Because technology can be used in multiple ways to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom, the best way to do this is by using facial action recognition technology that will be able to see if you need help or not. The author of paragraph 2 line 1 tells the student to use the facial recognition feature on her computer so it can be easier to understand for her. For example, a student may have trouble understand the concept, but the computer can make it understand what she's feeling. The student would be able to respond with the technology in no time, with their face expressions they can learn the material tha they would've been taught. Also this technology could increase the learning horizons and help teachers in the classroom with grading.

The idea of detecting a emotions facial expression may seem like an impossibilty, but we all know how much technology is advancing in the past and the future. If technology could accurately read the emotional expressions of children the world could be open to many innovations, including facial recognition. The passage explains in paragraph 8 line 10 that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."". In paragrah 10 line 5 the author states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' This quote shows that the ability of this technology will expand the way humans learn by expanding their horizons.

In order for technology to truly succeed, we should make the use of technology in every classroom environment. To be truly successful in the classroom thats what the author says, even though we do not know exactly what we want to do. Humans are always changing, whether it be on social media, emotional media and even in class. This technology of reading facial expressions could make us a better person, learn better and be more engaged, if only in classrooms.",0.7

In the article, their author attempts to give an idea about why we should visit Venus, when they do not support the idea, that it is worth traveling to Venus. While they give tons of information on Venus, they are not the most effective in making a mission to Venus worthwhile.

""Despite the dangers it presents, scientists still believe that it is a worthy pursuit to travel to Venus."" They give the reader information about how our planet is similar to ours by saying that it is the only planet in our solar system that we aren't able to explore directly. They write about Venus' history, a volcanoe, and waterlike conditions on it's surface. The author gives facts about what it might be like to us if we could land in Venus.

A lot of readers are frightened about the fact about Venus. With the information that the author is trying to give, they seem to have a few ideas as to why the mission is worth it. There are several risks that Venus has to offer. The author presents the topic of the planet, but tries to push it through. Lastly, this article is an incredibly boring article for those that are interested in Venus. Their first idea is to focus on how it is referred to as Earth's twin, if they are not already aware of their own planet. They also list the major dangers that can affect the world. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author mentions the lack of information on Venus, and talks about how NASA is trying to find other solutions for these difficulties.

Even after giving tons of information, the author doesn't really promote a way to convince readers that travel to Venus is worth it. The author seems to be interested in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" by discussing a spacecraft designed specifically to last on Venus instead of trying to land on its surface. They also mention Venus was probably covered with oceans which could have supported various forms of life in its past. After the reading, the author states that NASA would want to explore this ""stellar"" planet. Their next and final point about it is the astronomers wanting to learn more about what Venus looks like, but the article lacks the information that the reader desires. Ultimately, it fails to do the task of making the planet worth it.

In conclusion, this article of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was written with a few errors and lacks, but they failed to do their best to convince the reader that Venus exploration is worth all the cons. They don't show enough evidence to back up their idea of the planet, even though they did mention it in their article. Lastly, the author fails to talk about how he thinks the dangers and cons of this idea should be addressed. Their conclusion to the story is simple, it's just not as clear as it seems to be made. There is no point made to make the point across how dangerous it is. Not being able to prove the points made on the other sidetangents of travel are worth it.",0.7
e_7kvcjy9z,-6,Reasons to Join the Seagoing 4 H club You help people in danger get to learn more about other people s customs and meet new people. The reasons why you get from this is just from the things. It says in paragraph 4 that UNRRA hired the Seagoing 4 H to take care of the horses young cows and mules that were shipped overseas and the text even describes their trip from greece to china. In article 5 it says how they get to friends and learn new things. The article talks about Luke and Don and how the cattle boys get to travel to all the places. Paragraph 7 is telling us about Luke and Don s job on the boats and how the animals got hurt so luke was there to check to see if they were o. K. They said It would take him about two time to get to the and and he meant to had a people on board. Those are some important reasons to join this program it will be like an adenturess for you and many of the people on these trips. Its a very good reason to join this so you can make new people and it will make your life fill with different of of feelings. Also it says The cattle boys job was to feed and take care of the animals. I m saying this is a wonderful reason to join because the job can be a little bit boring but it will still be very interesting and you will see new people and their culture you will meet new people and be with some you like. This program would be very fun. I would love to have a job like this and I hope you d enjoy it too.,0.95
e_23sxylr0,6,"hey my name is steamy and i would like to tell you all about venus because on the other side of the roiling sun and the fact that its so close to earth that some people might not know about but we can figure out some that may be a little dangerous. Howabout the fact that venus is called the "" evening star"" is one of our planets but also the second planet is also very close to the sun.

NASA has had to come up with ideas on how we can be able to travel abou venus. they havent found eevides yet so lets try it and see what happens there. But we all have to find out what could help us on other planets and figure out how to go about them.

all in all NASA thinks that venus can be safer and a more safe place to travel to. if we dont try and do this we will need to try again but for now on its a challenging planet to live on and to explore. all i have to say is that it is worth it til you find out what we can do on venus.",0.7
e_7b28u4ox,6,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author encourages humanity to rise up above the obstacles that have stopped us from exploring Venus in the past, and push forward into uncharted territory. He cites several reasons why humans might want to explore a planet with such harsh and unforgiving conditions, and he gives examples of solutions to the problems that these conditions cause. He uses compelling evidence and inspiring diction to support his claim that humanity should work towards exploring Venus. He supports this claim very well. One example of the evidence that he uses to support his claim is the fact that Venus bears many similarities to Earth, making it valuable in scientific reasearch. In paragraph four he writes: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" He follows this up by explaining that gathering information about Venus could very well provide us with valuable information about our own planet Earth. The author uses this evidence as the main reason that scientists would benefit from exploring the surface of Venus. One problem that the author encounters is the extremity of the conditions on Venus. However, he offers solutions to this problem later in the article, when he provides information on how NASA would combat the dangerous conditions on the surface and explore Venus without any harm coming to the people involved. In paragraph five he writes ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian surface."" The author includes this example of a solution for the harsh conditions of Venus to compell the reader towards believing that exploring Venus would be a valuable use of time and effort for human civilization, due to the fact that it is not only rich with information that could help us explain our own lives on Earth, but also because on the surface of Venus could collect this information without having to risk the safety of the explorers that are involved. This is a powerful use of evidence, because it provides examples of why we should attempt to explore Venus, and it then works towards removing our doubt of this claim by giving us evidence that the risks that would be faced on Venus could be reduced significantly. In conclusion the author's claim that humanity would benefit greatly from travelling to and exploring Venus is well supported, with both evidence that supports the idea that the information that we would gain would be valuable to us, and evidence that the risks that we would have to take would be small enough to ensure the safety of the people involved. The author inspires us to look beyond what we have at the moment and strive for a better future one where we can become a multiplanetary civilization that has the ability to explore other planets and, perhaps, other stars.",0.0
e_z39iznxl,0,"Limiting car usage can also help the environment. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. If you can reduce your car usage, you will be helping to protect the environment.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to global warming and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some US carintensive areas, this number can go up to 50%. By limiting car usage, these emissions can be drastically reduced, helping to mitigate climate change and improve air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can improve public health. Air pollution from cars has been linked to respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung cancer. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can improve air quality and reduce the risk of respiratory problems. For example, in Paris, France, a partial driving ban was implemented to clear the air of smog, which resulted in a significant reduction in air pollution and improved public health.

There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can save money. The cost of owning a car includes the purchase price, insurance, gas, and maintenance. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation, you can avoid these costs.

In conclusion, reducing car usage is not only beneficial for the environment but also for our health and wallets. It's time to consider alternative means of transportation and make our cities more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking.

Germany has also made an effort to limit automobile use by starting a community that has almost zero cars. Cars are forbidden in Vauban, Germany. 70 percent of the people in this city do not own cars and rely on bikes, scooters, and public transportation to get them around. A woman from source 1 says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this shows that people were not forced to be here for an experiment, it shows that life without cars, or at least a very limited ammount of them, can be very beneficial to not just the enviorment, but also the induvidual lives of the people that it is affecting. The city of Vauban has made an effort to be very dense and they have stores that are next to the residential area so citizens can walk there and not drive.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impact of car emissions on air quality. Intense smog levels in the city prompted the enforcement of a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for individuals to live in.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting public health, fostering connected communities, and potentially bringing economic benefits, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential that we prioritize implementing strategies to limit car usage and promote alternative transportation options for the benefit of all.",0.875

e_90siec5r,-5,"As an eighthgrade student, I believe that problems are opportunities to do your best and learn from your mistakes. There are several reasons why I hold this belief.

Firstly, problems provide a challenge that pushes us to think critically and creatively. When we encounter a problem, we are forced to analyze it and come up with a solution. This process of problemsolving helps us develop our analytical and decisionmaking skills. For example, when I was working on a science project, I encountered a problem with the experiment not producing the expected results. Instead of giving up, I researched and came up with a new hypothesis that led to a successful outcome. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and not giving up in the face of challenges.

Secondly, problems allow us to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves. When we make a mistake, it is an opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and how we can do better next time. This process of selfreflection helps us grow as individuals and become more resilient. For example, when I struggled with a math problem, I asked my teacher for help and learned a new technique that made the problem much easier to solve. This experience taught me the importance of asking for help and not being afraid to learn from my mistakes.

Finally, problems can lead to unexpected outcomes that we may not have achieved if we had not encountered the problem in the first place. For example, when I was working on a group project in history, we encountered a problem with one of our sources. Instead of giving up, we decided to do additional research and found a new source that provided a more indepth perspective on the topic. This experience taught me the importance of being open to new ideas and perspectives and not being afraid to take risks.

In conclusion, problems are opportunities to do your best and learn from your mistakes. They provide a challenge that pushes us to think critically and creatively, allow us to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves, and can lead to unexpected outcomes that we may not have achieved otherwise. As an eighthgrade student, I believe that it is important to embrace problems and view them as a chance to grow and learn.",1.0
e_4fw1wckh,4,"Automated vehicles are nice and all, but when it comes donw to it, ahuman should be responsible for his or her own actions on the road. The use of automated automotives just seems to be a liitle too risky to use on roads within the next few years. Automated automobiles might sound like a good idea in theory, but technology fails all of the time and I would not be surprised whatsoever if lawsuits sprung up in the near future, due to accidents caused by socalled ""smart"" cars. There are currently no laws regarding smart cars, smart cars are unreliable, and smart cars would not offer the same experience as a normal vehicle would.

One would assume that driverless cars are 100% safe. That is a very false statement, as drivers may still take control of the wheel. Who is to say that a driver would not just grab the wheel, drive off of the side of the road, and attempt to sue a car manufacturer for a faulty product? There are little to no laws regarding selfautomated vehicles in most states. New sets of laws and other rules would have to be put in place in order to maintain peace between civilians and car manufacturers. Paragraph 9 states that new laws would have to be made in order to assure liability to a specific party if one got in a crash due to the smart cars. It seems highly impractical, and it also seems like a waste of precious time and money.

Smart cars may sound very safe and enjoyable in theory, but all technology has the capability to fail at any given moment. Imagine a world where driverless cars are simply rolling along down the streets, and perhaps one combusts here, or another veers off of the road there. Paragraph 7 talks about how some cars are only partially automated, and that is honestly the best way to handle the situation. A driver should still be responsible and should be able to make hisher own decisions on what to do on the road. There are dangers in this as well, because some people are not bright enough to use and understand the technology to its full advantage, and could cause problems in the process of maintaining the vehicle. If a vehicle has multiple sensors scattered around its body, those sensors can be tampered with and can malifunction whether it be intentional, or a simple mistake, accidents do occur on the road.

There is no experience in the world like driving a car. Kids look forward to it their whole lives! Girls will get cars on their 16th or 17th birthday and SURPRISE! YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY GET TO DRIVE IT! A computer will do it for you! To me, that does not sound appealing or very fun in the slightest sense. Imagine sitting at the sterring wheel and dozing off, due to the fact that you have not had to touch the sterring wheel in miles. Dozing off at the wheel could be a fatal experience. Making drivers operate a vehicle is much safer than allowing a computer to do so, because it should be the choice of the driver as to what happens on the road. In paragraph 8, a psychologist states that automated vehicles could cause drivers at the wheel to get bored. Boredom leads to weariness, which will eventually lead to sleep, which in turn could result in a fatal accident to the driver, a passenger, or pedestrianscyclist. If someone did not want to drive or take responibilty for it, they could have someone else drive, they could ride a train, or fly in an airplane! It just seems so unrealistic and kind of ridiculous that someone would actually want to be driven by a machine. If a person owns a car, they should be responsible for managing it and whatever occurs on the open road.

There is no practical use for smart cars in a modern day society. Perhaps in the future, when technology is more advanced and when the people of the world are even more brain dead than they currently are, we could have smart cars driving people freely throughout the streets. Smart cars will never live up to the security and safety measures of vehicles operated by a human driver. Smart cars are a lot more trouble than they seem to be worth. Smart cars would require new laws, maintenace and regular repair so a malifunction may not occur, and trust in a machine that could fail at any given moment. Smart cars will only make the human mind much more lazy, and we will continue to degress as a society if we allow smart cars to become our preferred mode of transportation.",0.0

e_s8jdo7o7,4,"People say that technology is forever changing, getting better, and more advanced. Some for the good, and some for the bad. Today they are trying to invent cars that drive themselves but still require a driver. However, I don't feel like driverless cars are necessary in today's world. There is too much room for error, just like any piece of technology, there are errors, and things can break. Talking about driverless cars means to trust your life with some piece of technology. I want to be confident when I'm driving, meaning, I'm in full control of what I'm doing. I don't want to have to blame anyone else but my self if I cause an accident.

The first couple statements of the passage states"" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? He envisions a future with a publictransport system where fleets of driverless cars form a public transport taxi system."" I can't imagine a time like that because there is a million of people out there who are able to drive perfectly by themselves. I don't think that people want to have to rely on calling a driverless car to come pick them up to take them to work or go to other places. People like to be selfsufficient, get up and go whenever they want to. People don't want anything holding them back or preventing them of what they want to do.

The passage also states ""Most laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" If they continue to go on with the idea of driverless cars, a lot of events have to go right for them. It's going to take a lot of time, to propose new driving laws and getting the technology where they want it to be. I believe if it's not broke, don't fix it. Also, if there were to be an accident in one of these cars, the question of liability could cause a lot of problems and headaches. I question the safety of these cars and how reliable they are. I don't think that many people would trust their life with a car that can drive itself.

Driving is a private and a huge stepping stone in life. Driving also comes with a lot of responsibility, and educates people on safety, and help with social interaction. Driverless cars also take the fun out of driving. Teenager boys and girls can not wait until they turn the legal age and can get behind the wheel and drive. Teenager vision themselves driving anywhere and everywhere after they get their license. Going to driverless cars makes driving boring and doesn't teach young adults the responsibility and importance of safety while driving. Paragraph 8 states"" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get board waiting for their turn to drive?"" It also limits what they learn, like the laws and rules of the roads while driving. Driving is necessary in most people's lives today, and a lot of people enjoy driving.

Driverless cars sound like they can be very expensive. If Sergey Brin's envision holds true, where are they going to get the money to provide cars for everyone in the world who needs them?

I do not support driverless cars because there is too much room for error, I don't want to rely on a car to pick me up and take me places. Driverless cars limit the learning potential about driving for beginner drivers. Driving is fine the way it is now, they just need to focus their attention on the cars people drive today.

Venus is sometimes called The Evening Star. While Venus is very simple to see from a good distant but a safe point of Earth it is proved that is very challenging to study more closely. I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because we should travel and study more planets to see what else lives beyond us dangers shouldn t hold us back from meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation and Venus has value and us humans are curious. The first reason why we should study Venus is because we should travel and study more planets to see what else lives beyond us. Venus is often referred to as Earth s twin because of the size and density. Earth Venus and Mars our other plantary neighbors. Venus may be scary to travel too. But people should study Venus first and if they would want to risk their lives to see what is up there and how Venus is then they could. They could also try making special suits so that you could survive if you go to Venus. In the text it says Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Well if that is a issue then they need to study Venus more and then make suits that can prevent the heat from coming towards them so they could survive the travel and come back with pictures information. etc. This is one reason why we should study Venus because it is a worthy pursuit. The second reason why we should study Venus is because dangers shouldn t hold us back from meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation. They say in the text On the planet s surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Once people hear this type of information they get scared because they don t want to die from heat. But you got to realize how Venus may look or how interesting it might be. Venus was the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. Long ago Venus was covered largely with oceans and supported various forms of life just like Earth. Maybe if we study Venus you could find fossils or things that were left there. It use to be beautiful but you never know what was left. In my opinion we should keep investigating and try making suits that can not the pressure like that so they could go to Venus and see how it actually looks now and what if they see anything. That is my second reaoson why we should study Venus because it is a worthy pursuit. The third reason why we should study Venus is because Venus has value and us humans are curious. In the text it states Striving t meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally initimidating endeavors. Really it means most people are scared to travel to Venus because of the heat issues. But really people are wondering how Venus actually looks. People are going to start making things up about how Venus looks or false information because going to Venus is like a death sentence.

e_cq0wtxb1,-1,"Dear principal,

I think that it's a great idea to change the policy so that students must have at least a B average to participate in sports and other school related activity. This will be good because if they aren't doing well academically then why should they get to go play or do something else with their time? They need to pay attention in class and learn what they are supposed to learn!

If you change the grade averages of kids who want to participate in certain things, maybe some kids would try harder and actually focus on learning instead of fooling around all day long. If we let them keep playing or participating even though they don't have the right grades, they won't care about their work as much. That way they wont take advantage of this new rule and start paying more attention in class. It might make a big difference in our schools test scores!

It is important to me personally that everyone pays attention in classes and does their best no matter what, but especially when trying out for any sport or team. I know that if i wasn't able to join my basketball team unless i had above average grades, I would most definitely try my hardest just so I could still play. Some people may not agree, but I really believe that this is a wonderful opportunity for many children to improve themselves. Even if it only improves one person to raise hisher grades, then it was worth changing the whole entire school's rules. You never know how someone's life can turn around from raising her grades from C' s to A' s .",0.9
e_9nhmy40q,-2,"During the early modern period in Europe, spanning from the late 15th century to the late 18th century, the role of common people in politics was complex and varied significantly across time and place. On the one hand, most political power officially rested with monarchs and ruling elites. Yet on the other hand, the people participated in politics through both formal and informal means, influencing policy and expressing dissent when needed. Overall, scholars interpret the role of the people in early modern politics as growing over time, with an increasing voice and presence from the 16th century onward due to factors like the Protestant Reformation. However, the extent of popular participation still varied based on numerous social, cultural, and institutional realities.

To understand the role of the people, we must first define 'politics' in the context of early modern Europe. Politics referred to more than just matters of the state or government institutions. It encompassed ""all areas of collective decision making and activity,"" including local matters like poverty relief or crime prevention. While common people had little direct power over central government institutions, they were involved in local and communal politics. They also expressed dissatisfaction with rulers and policies through riots, protests, and rebellions. So, we must consider politics broadly to fully assess the role of early modern European people. 

In terms of formal participation, common people in towns and cities had opportunities to vote for and serve in representative assemblies. However, only small percentages of people actually enjoyed such rights, typically affluent property owners and merchants. Rural peasants rarely had any formal political rights or representation. Over time, revolutions led to demands for more representative institutions with wider suffrage, as in the English Civil Wars in the 1640s and 1650s. Still, most political power remained concentrated among elites.

Informal participation, on the other hand, included attending public ceremonies, voicing grievances with petitions or protests, rioting, and other forms of unrest. Such extrainstitutional participation allowed even disenfranchised common folk to influence rulers and policies. The people thus demonstrated a nascent form of public opinion in politics. However, the diversity of early modern Europe made popular participation uneven. Cultural, religious, and economic differences across countries and regions shaped how and how much the people got involved. 

In conclusion, the role of common Europeans in politics during the early modern period was complex and evolving. While most formal power rested with rulers and institutions, the people shaped politics through informal participation and an emerging public voice. Yet the extent of popular involvement varied greatly based on the diversity of societies across time and place. As politics came to encompass more areas of life beyond government, people at all levels of society found ways to influence collective decision making, though often not through official means. Scholars thus interpret the political role of early modern common people as constrained but gradually growing, reflecting the tumults of a period marked by both rigid inequalities as well as radical calls for liberty and representation.",1.0

I also believe it is not suitable for small states. Electrol College is based on the population of your states. You have small states like Alaska and Hawaii who have only 3 or 4 elections and other major states like Texas and Florida have29 or 38 election votes. Candidates participating for the president go to larger states than in small states, because they know that if they convince the larger states, ""Electral Callege Legge can close the powerful voters for a canate.There is no hope of carrying one's own state.

e_vx1j9nd4,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to share my perspective on the debate around keeping the Electoral College versus instituting a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. There are reasonable points on both sides of this issue, and it deserves thorough consideration. 

those in favor of keeping the electoral college argue That it Encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing Only on a few High population states. However, it is also true that the system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has happened a few times in our nation's history, most recently in 2000 and 2016. It is understandable why many see this as unfair and undemocratic.

Supporters of a popular vote counter that it would make every vote equal and ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide wins. They Believe This better Adheres to the democratic Principle of one person, one Vote. However, others warn that candidates may still focus their efforts only on population centers under a popular vote system. Swing States could simply be replaced by swing counties in a handful Of pivotal states. 

An additional concern with eliminating the electoral college Is that it May require a constitutional Amendment, which can be An Extensive undertaking. Some propose workarounds like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, but that too faces legal uncertainties. Abrupt change to such a core part of our electoral process could have unintended consequences. 

In the end, there are goodfaith perspectives on both sides of this debate. As the senator representing citizens with a variety of views, any policy change you support should aim to uphold democratic values while avoiding reactive, unilateral decisions. A thorough public discussion and bipartisan commission could help develop reforms that garner broad consensus. The choice we make will have longlasting impact, so wisdom and care are needed. I appreciate you considering this complex issue from all angles.",1.0
e_5eo9wrss,2,"Introduction

Have you heard of the Face on Mars? It's a huge rock formation that looks like a human face. Some people think it was created by aliens, but scientists say it's just a natural landform. In this essay, I'm going to use evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to argue that the Face is a natural formation.

Body

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" by Michael H. Carr and Kenneth L. Edgett presents a number of arguments against the idea that the Face was created by aliens. First, the article points out that the Face is not unique. There are many other rock formations on Mars that look like faces. Second, the article argues that the Face is not the right size or shape to have been created by aliens. If aliens were going to create a face on Mars, they would have made it bigger and more symmetrical. Third, the article says that the Face is located in an area of Mars that is not very hospitable to life. The climate in this area is cold and dry, and there is no evidence that there was ever any liquid water on the surface.

Conclusion

Based on the evidence presented in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" I believe that the Face is a natural formation. It is not the product of alien design, but rather the result of erosion and other geological processes.",1.0
e_90x7j5rg,-2,"To what extent were women in early modern England completely subservient to their husbands, and how did their socioeconomic background and other pillars of authority play a role in shaping their experience of marriage?

The notion that women in early modern England were completely subservient to their husbands is an oversimplification that does not reflect the complex realities of women's experiences. While legally and economically men held primary power and authority within marriage, women had varying degrees of agency and influence that were shaped by several factors, including their social class, family relationships, and participation in community and church groups.

Socioeconomically and legally, women held an inferior and subordinate role to their husbands that cannot be discounted. English common law established the principle of coverture, where upon marriage a womans legal rights and obligations were subsumed under those of her husband. Women could not own property or sign contracts in their own name. All of their wages, property, and material belongings became their husband's.  This gave men nearly absolute power and control over their wives lives. From a financial and legal perspective, marriage dramatically reduced women's independence and authority.

For poor and workingclass women, this meant a precarious existence and dependence on their husbands for basic survival. Yet they also continued to play an important economic role, participating in household production, craft work, and agricultural labor. If their husbands died, mistreated them, or abandoned them, they had little means of financial support. Some had more choice in partner and greater bargaining power before marriage, but ultimately possessed little authority or independence within the relationship. 

Middle and upperclass women had more social connections and family resources to draw upon, but were still legally and financially dependent on their husbands. However, they often married as part of strategic alliances between families, meaning they and their kin had more leverage in the choice of partner and management of marital dynamics. Some women gained informal power and worked as partners in managing family estates and finances. While still subordinate, they operated with more authority and mutual dependence in their relationships.   

Within the home, most women across classes retained certain customary rights and responsibilities, including oversight of children, household management, and domestic duties. Though still subject to their husbands, these domains provided a space for autonomy and selfexpression. Outside the home, women participated in community groups, charity work, and churches, where some gained respect, friendship, and purpose.

In conclusion, while legally and economically subordinate, women in early modern England did not live lives of total subservience or lack of agency within  marriage. Their socioeconomic backgrounds, family relationships, community ties, and customary rights shaped varying degrees of authority, interdependence, and purpose in relation to their husbands. Their experiences challenge the notion that they were simply silent, oppressed, and powerless victims of the patriarchal system. Overall, the reality was far more multifaceted, as women worked within and pushed against predominant structures to gain some measure of partnership, influence, and dignity as wives.",1.0
e_qi2306vd,-1,"Do you think that asking more then one person for advice is a good idea? When someone asks for advice do they ask onlyone person or do they ask more than one person. I think it would be better to ask more than one person because, if your going to make the right choice you have to know whats best for you and for others too.

One reason why i think its important to ask more than one person for advice when making a decision is so you can see things from different perspectives. This means you get an insight on how other people feel about this topic. You will probably find out some new information and also learn something. Asking more than one person has many benefits but just like anything else there are cons as well.

Another reason why im saying to ask more than one person is so that way you could understand what everyone thinks about it. If you were to ask one person their opinion might not be the same as the others who you asked. You should always talk with someone before doing something because thats whats going to help you decide if what youre thinking of doing is wrong or right. Its very smart to go around and talk to different people before deciding which path your going to take. Just remember that whenever you ask someone for advice don't always listen to them. Sometimes people give bad advice and you need to figure out which ones are good and which ones arent.

The last thing i want to say is, sometimes when your trying to figure out whats the right thing to do you should write down all your options and try to weigh them out. Also writing things down helps you realize whats really important and whats not. When you do this you can compare all the pros and cons and then choose the option that has the most pros. Writing things down is a great way to get your thoughts out and maybe even clearer in your head. Whenever someone gives me advice i usually dont follow exactly what they said cause im my own person and i think differently than anyone else does. But sometimes we need someone else to tell us what to do and that person should really care about our choices.

In conclusion,asking more than one person for advice is always a good idea. It makes sense since we live in such a diverse world filled with lots of different people who each have their own opinions. That being said, i believe that seeking multiple opinions can lead to a better outcome. The main reasons why are because, if your going to make the right choice you have to know whats best for you and for others too. Another reason why i think its important to ask more than one person for advice is so that way you could understand what everyone thinks about it. Lastly,the last thing i want to say is, sometimes when your trying to figure out whats the right thing to do you should write down all your options and try to weigh them out. The three reasons i listed above are ways you could benefit from asking more than one person instead of just one person. There are plenty more reasons and ways you could benefit but these are the ones that stand out the most to me.",0.9
e_0r95logs,4,"I think that driverless cars would be a very positive thing. The big reasons for this are that without drivers there would be less accidents, they would be more efficient with gas, and there would be no need for insurance. So overall a big improvement on today's society.

Firstly without drivers there would be fewer accidents. Now since not everyone would be able to afford to use them there will still be accidents but the number will be drastic reduced. Since the car is driving itself there is no way that the driver can drive recklessly therefore greatly reducing the number of car crashes. So even if one of the driverless cars gets into an accident it would be the manufacturer's fault because they are the ones hat are really driving here. So overall a lot safer than what we have now.

My next reason is that these cars a lot more gas efficient. The reason I say this is that they would always obey the speed limit exactly. Doing this should cut down on the gas used and therefore be much more efficient. In the long run this sales everyone money except the gas stations.

Lastly this should decrease the need for insurance. In the article they said that these would be more like a taxi service so if they are taxi than no need for people to have insurance on cars. If everyone used these than no more need for car insurance at all. Which in turn saves even more money for people. So overall very good cost wise for people.

So these driverless cars will be a very positive thing. They will reduce car crashes, be more gas efficient, and decrease the need for insurance. In conclusion these cars will be awesome.",0.0
e_tgoy8jlh,0,"Title: Promoting Limited Car Usage: Benefits and Global Adoptions 

The world is gradually becoming aware of the advantages of limiting car usage. Communities across the globe are embracing innovative, ecofriendly ways of life centered around low car usage, primarily to combat rising environmental and health challenges. This approach to life offers many advantages worth identifying and integrating into societies everywhere. 

Within Germany, lies the community of Vauban, a pioneer in adopting alternative transportation methods. By prohibiting onstreet parking and home garages, mandating distant parking spots, and emphasizing the convenience of its tram to the downtown area, 70 percent of Vauban community has forfeited car ownership Rosenthal. The carfree streets in this district have reduced the greenhouse gas emissions, toxic pollutants, and traffic congestion associated with car usage while enhancing the tranquility of life in the community. The health benefits associated with this lifestyle have been attested to by residents who seem to be happier due to reduced daily stress Rosenthal. 

Paris, on the other hand, has implemented stringent policies to curtail its burgeoning pollution problem caused mainly by dense car usage that led to smog levels rivalling some of the most polluted cities worldwide Duffer. To tackle this, Paris imposed a partial driving ban depending on numberplated days, significant reductions in citywide congestion were realized Duffer. This method offers a systematic way to reduce car usage on particular days, thereby decreasing smog levels and potential health risks. 

In Colombia, the capital city Bogota has taken an approach to limit car usage by implementing a 'Day Without Cars' yearly, where only buses and taxis are permitted on the roads Selsky. This initiative aims at promoting alternative modes of transport and reducing smog. The yearly event has gathered large turnouts despite unfavorable weather conditions and has inspired other cities in the country to join Selsky. Such initiatives not only contribute to lower pollution levels but also raise community consciousness towards the harmful effects of high car usage. 

Contrary to popular belief in the United States that the love for cars is irreplaceable, a shift away from the car culture is noticeable. Notably, it seems individuals are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses annually Rosenthal. This cultural shift precipitates a decrease in carbon emissions while negatively impacting car producers. However, the automobile industry is responding by rebranding themselves as 'mobility companies,' aware that the trend may not reverse soon enough Rosenthal. 

Limiting car usage poses numerous benefits from improved health due to reduced stress and pollution, a less crowded and safer environment achieved by decreasing the number of cars on roads, and lowered carbon emissions to combat global warming. However, adapting to a new transportation culture requires substantial shifts in social culture and the provision of efficient, reliable, and affordable public transportation services. It is therefore encouraging that areas such as Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States have experimented with decreased car dependence and succeeded in numerous ways. Thus, the prospects of decreasing car usage are realistic and very much achievable if the benefits are well articulated, and efficient alternate transportation options are made available.",1.0

How important is a persons car to them? Do they really need have their own car? It would be more ecofriendly if they just car pooled, or even walked. It seems this question occurred to a lot of people in high places. These then their to ban cars in many busy cities, with marvelous results.

Some where in Germany, there's a social experiment going on. This experiment is taking place in a small suburban town called Vauban. The people in community have taken a huge leap of faith and got rid of all cars. But don't worry, couldn't happier. Their streets are nearly empty with virtually no traffic, they have less stress, and they don't have to worry about all the expenses that come with car ownership. The streets are very close together with stores on pratically every corner, to prevent having to go long distances. All they have to do is take a nice stroll down main street and have everything their fingertips. They have to worry about people parking on front lawns, people flying dangerously fast down the street. It's just simple and easy.

Granted, having a car available does have benefits. Owning a car can give people a sense of freedom. It's like a reassurance that no matter what, people have the means to get something done. Without having to depend on others. If there's an emergency, people don't want to have to wait for the next bus to come through. They want to get there as quickly as possible. Owning a car makes that possible. Owning a car can also make visiting that aunt that lives three states away possible. Without having to ride a cramped, smelly bus to get there.

On the other hand, going without a car certainly has more pros than cons. less stress, it's cheaper, there's less traffic, it's healthier, and there's less pollution. For instance, in Paris, there was so much smog, they had to ban cars. If people violated the ban they had to pay a fine, or even get their car impounded. They blamed diesel the smog, because in France, that's nearly 67 percent of cars fuel. The cities smog rivaled Bejings', and that's the most polluted city in the world! Going without a car is also less stressful. People don't have to worry about how they'll make the next car payment, or how they might run out of gas. There's also virtually no chance of getting in an accident. Afterall, how is someone going to get in an accident without a car?

Not only is going without a car the better economical its the best personal choice. Why would someone deliberately put themsleves through the stress of owning a car, when they can easily go without? Though it has some benefits, like being independent, those benefits are greatly outnumbered by the pros of going without. It's just cheaper and less stressful.

This kind of technology will help students and teachers form a better trust, help make teaching improvements, and learning improvements. A computer able to do that, will be valuable to all teachers and to those who want to better their education.

Even when someone fakes an expression, the zygomatic major and the risorius facial muscles will tell so. If a student were to perhaps lie after being confronted for cheating, the computer would be able to read his facial expressions and tell if it is geniune or not. With a computer reading yours and others facial expressions daily, it may help the classroom build a better trust with eachother. The computer will tell their true emotions, even when some try to hide it.

When the professor is teaching something that the students may not understand, they will be confused. Sometimes the teacher is so deep into the learning lesson, they will not realize when some students are not understanding. A computer will help by reading their facial expressions and send a message to the teacher explaining so, then they can realize they either need to slow down or go over it again. This helps the teacher understand the progress of where their students are at and how to better their teaching.

When a subject has caused students to grow bored, the computer will send a message to the teacher and he may make it more interesting, or change it up a bit. Said by Dr. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communications.."".

Sometimes students will not raise their hand when they have a question or are confused to avoid making themselves look foolish for not knowing. The teacher may take in consideration from the message sent from the computer that he needs call out on those students, getting them more involved. This will help shy students better their learning possibilities.

In conclusion, technology that is able to read facial expressions and tell how that person is feeling will improve all learning schools. The technology helps build a stronger trust, since the technology makes it impossible for people to hide their emotions. It will also value students and teachers, helping improve their learning zones.",0.0

e_5ym2x11a,0,"Limiting car usage would result in a number of advantages for fellow citizens. Firstly, it would reduce traffic congestion, which improves transportation efficiency and reduces fuel consumption and air pollution. According to the passage set, traffic congestion in the United States has increased by approximately 230% in the last twenty years, causing an increase in fuel consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as air pollution, which contributes to climate change. Reducing the number of cars on the road would alleviate this congestion, reducing the amount of fuel consumed and improving air quality.

Secondly, limiting car usage would also reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on the roads. The passage set states that car accidents are a leading cause of death for people between the ages of 15 and 29, and that many of these accidents are caused by reckless driving, speeding, and alcohol consumption. By reducing the number of cars on the road, the number of accidents and fatalities would decrease, making the roads safer for all users.

In addition, limiting car usage would also have economic benefits for citizens. The passage set states that the cost of owning and operating a car is increasing, due to rising fuel prices and maintenance costs. By reducing the number of cars on the road, citizens would save money on transportation costs, which could be used for other purposes, such as education or healthcare.

In conclusion, limiting car usage would result in a number of advantages for fellow citizens, including reduced traffic congestion, decreased accidents and fatalities, and economic benefits.

e_r2shiak6,1,"What is a Electoral College? A Electoral College is a process, not a place. My 3 reasons what is an Electoral College is : Why do we need a Electoral College, Whats wrong with it, and 5 reasons why we choose a president. We have to find out whats going on with this Electoral College. If we don't something might happen. We will find the truth about the Electoral College.

Whats wrong with Electoral College?

Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president ,

according to paragraph 10 . Again they said if you live intexas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. All the votes that people vote for really aren't voting, there just voting for the slate electors. The electors choose which one they will vote for, but is that any fair, for the people, they make a choice to vote, there not being forced to vote by command. People like to vote because they want a new leader or, for instance, somebody like President Barack Obama. He is going into his 6 year as president.

Why do we need a Electoral College?

The Electoral College consists of 539 electors, according to paragraph 3.

A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the lection of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

What are the reasons why we choose a president?

The reasons why we choose a president is because of the swing states, and the big states. Swing states is a winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on tht tossup states. Next is the Big States, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virture of the malapportionmentof the senate. The Big States are like : Texas, Californina, and Florida. But this doesn't annoy me because people still have a chance to vote whether or not, the votes don't to the congress.

In Conclusion, Electoral College is a wellknown thing when to choose a president or vice president or even governer. Elecotral College is important, you can say that because maybe you agree to it but i still don't because the votes aren't really going to the votes to the congress, the votes really go to the slate of governers or the senate but the the senate or congress are really the real people that can choose the president or vice president.",0.0

The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting.

Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning.

There are many situations that could take place with a driverless car, but also the fact that they will not be made completely driverless. A person still has to be aware of the surroundings and be ready for any case that the car may stop driving and theywould have to take over.

In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming,"" the author describes that the cars being developed at the moment, still do not meet the standards of being completely driverless. In Paragraph 7, the author states that, ""In fact none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" These cars all notify the human driver when the road ahead requires human skills. This means thats the driver has to remain alert and ready to take over.

A downside to a driverless car is the fact that the driver still has to be monitored by the humans inside. The humans could easily get bored andor fall asleep behind the wheel. The cars would have to alert the human that they need to take over. Car manufacturers are considering using headsup displays that warn the driver when to take control of the situation. Imagine if the driver is asleep and jolts awake after being awakened by the displays installed. The driver has the potential to hit the steering wheel and cause the car to swerve into a ditch or tree, maybe even fly off a bridge. The manufacturers are considering making one of the displays blinking flashing lights that are placed on the windshield, but what if they blind you and you can't adjust your eyes to the light, you grab the steering wheel and try to stop the car but it is too late.

What if there is a mistake in the production of the car and the autopiolet of the car shuts off? Who is at fault for the accident? The car is supposed to drive for you and you are supposed to be able to relax. What if a person that can not afford a smart car is speeding down the street while your car is driving for you? What if the sensors don't detect them fast enough? What if there is fault with the wiring of the car, caused by weather or overheating?
